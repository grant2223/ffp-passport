# FFP PASSPORT — MASTER (THE single source of truth — there is only ONE)

> 🥇 THIS IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF TRUTH. Read it first, every session. If any other doc disagrees, MASTER wins.
> All other docs are reference-only and live in `/archive` (consolidated 2026-06-12 — 26 scattered docs, including
> a second file literally named "Source of Truth", were moved there so nothing competes with this file). The
> cross-app contract the booking team reads also lives in the DB `platform_docs` (key='source_of_truth'), unchanged.
> ⚠️ COMMIT THIS FILE TO GITHUB. The repo→workspace sync wipes any local file not in the repo
> (it already wiped this doc once). Memory lives here — push it so it survives. Commit the `/archive` move too.

> 🎨 DESIGN STANDARD — NON-NEGOTIABLE (Grant, 2026-07-08): **NO box/pill designs. EVER.** Reference bar = **Apple (HIG) + WHOOP**.
> BANNED: pill/chip badges as default UI, "box soup" (everything in bordered/filled rounded cards), chunky rounded tags, candy chips,
> stat-in-a-box grids. INSTEAD: content-forward, generous whitespace, strong TYPE hierarchy (big numerals, 1–2 weights), HAIRLINE
> separators not boxes, edge-to-edge/full-bleed, restrained palette, calm + premium. If it reads "chips in boxes" it's WRONG — redo to
> Apple/WHOOP calibre. EVERY surface (Passport, Pro, Partner, Admin, emails) + every mockup. Do WAY better. (Full rule: CLAUDE.md.)
>
> 🎯 NEXT PRIORITY (Grant, 2026-06-28): **SHRINK `ffp-member-dashboard.html`** — it is **13,737 lines / 1.8 MB** in ONE file.
> STOP adding inline JS/CSS to it. Extract large blocks (panels, modals, helpers, CSS) into lazy `assets/*.js` loaders
> (the existing `_panelLoaderSrc` pattern), ONE module at a time, NO behaviour change, cache-bust via `FFP_BUILD`,
> PLAN-FIRST + get Grant's go before editing, verify on device. Never a big-bang rewrite. (Full directive: CLAUDE.md top block.)
> Last updated: 2026-07-17 (build constants READ from the files this session):
> • member **`FFP_BUILD='592'`** — single source `assets/ffp-build.js` L4 (READ this turn; the earlier header said 595 but the file reverted to 592 — corrected). LOADERS cache-bust by their OWN `?v=` on the script tag (e.g. `ffp-quests-core.js?v=27`, `ffp-coach-loader.js?v=523`), NOT by FFP_BUILD — bump the `?v=` when you edit a loader.
> • pro **`PRO_BUILD='141'`** — FFP Professional app/index.html L726. Pro loaders cache-bust via `?v='+PRO_BUILD`.
> • admin footer **`build v62`** — ffp-admin-dashboard.html; each admin loader has its OWN `?v=` in `_panelScript` (e.g. `ffp-admin-exercises-loader.js?v=4`).
> • backend `BACKEND_VERSION` — unchanged this stretch (last v169).
> ⚠️ The device avatar **"Build N"** is the ONLY truth for what is DEPLOYED. Local file edits AND these MASTER entries are NOT live/visible to Grant until he COMMITS them — the sync wipes local-only files (this is why MASTER updates were not showing). Every change I hand over states: files + the file's own version/`?v=` + build number, and "commit these incl. FFP-MASTER.md".

## LATEST — 2026-07-18 (bj) — BOOKING SITE (findfitpeople.com): ★ NETLIFY FUNCTIONS WERE NEVER DEPLOYED. Places map now carries its data on the map.
Scope: **booking platform folder only** (`FFP Booking Platform`) — no Passport/backend/DB change. Grant deploys by dragging the WHOLE folder into Netlify ("drop" deploy); there is no build constant on this site.
- **ROOT CAUSE FOUND (verified via the Netlify API this turn, not assumed).** Deploy `6a5b58dc569046790c3f9972` (2026-07-18 10:43 UTC, `deploy_source: "drop"`) reports `"available_functions": []` and summary message **"No functions deployed"**. A drag-and-drop deploy uploads static assets only — it does not pick up `netlify/functions/` unless a `netlify.toml` in the folder root declares the directory. There was **no netlify.toml**.
  → This means `/.netlify/functions/*` has been returning 404 the whole time, so **`ai-agent.js` (Ask Grant) and `ai-search.js` have never been live either** — not just the new `places.js`. Ask Grant has been calling a dead endpoint.
- **FIX — NEW FILE `netlify.toml`** (folder root): `[build] publish="."` + `[functions] directory="netlify/functions"`, `node_bundler="esbuild"`. Verified all three functions are dependency-free (`grep -c "require("` = **0** for ai-agent.js, ai-search.js, places.js), so they run unbundled with no npm install.
- **`GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY` is set in Netlify** (secret; scoped Builds/Functions/Runtime; 4 deploy contexts) — confirmed from Grant's screenshot. Google Cloud key "FFP Booking – Netlify", app restriction None, API restriction **Places API (New)**. Key never reaches the browser; `netlify/functions/places.js` is the only caller.
- **`js/map.js` REWRITTEN (253 lines, ends `})();` — RULE 3.1 verified this turn).** Grant: *"we have locations dots... with ZERO information... how does that help?"* and *"it should show my location.... obviously"*.
  - Markers are now **labelled**: venue name + ★rating rendered in TYPE on the map (Google-Maps style) instead of anonymous `circleMarker` dots. White text-halo, no boxes/pills — complies with the DESIGN STANDARD.
  - **Declutter pass** (`declutter()`, runs on `zoomend`/`moveend`): markers walked best-known-first (sorted by `userRatingCount` desc), any label whose 156×30px screen box overlaps one already placed is hidden — the dot always stays. Labels suppressed entirely below zoom 13.
  - **"You are here"**: live blue dot + accuracy ring (`drawMe()`), seeded by `getCurrentPosition` then kept current by `watchPosition`. Location-denied and no-geolocation now produce real copy instead of silence.
  - FFP partners = gold markers, `zIndexOffset 1000`, `marks.unshift()` so they get first claim on label space.
- **`css/styles.css`:** added `.vmk-i/.vmk/.vmk-dot/.vmk-txt/.vmk-n/.vmk-s/.vmk-ffp` (marker labels; category tints fitness=`--blue`, clubs `#2e7d6b`, wellness `#b0813f`) and `.me-i/.me-dot/.me-ring` (position dot). Inserted after `.placemap .leaflet-control-attribution`.
- **⚠️ INCOMPLETE / UNPROVEN — do not call this fixed.** Grant: *"20 venues here... but when you do this it does nothing???"* then **"no fucken assumptions"** — correctly called out a RULE 0 violation: I claimed the map's own click handler was hiding the card WITHOUT verifying it. A `lastPick` timestamp guard + `L.DomEvent.stopPropagation` were added to the marker click handlers on that unverified hypothesis. **The real cause of "tap does nothing" is still UNKNOWN.** Next step is the browser console on `/map.html` while tapping a pin — do not assert a cause until that is seen.
- **ALSO UNVERIFIED:** the live JSON shape from `/.netlify/functions/places` has never been read (web_fetch returns no body for it). Rating/photo/open-now rendering is written to the documented Places (New) response, not to an observed one.
- **DEPLOY:** Grant drags the folder again. Success = the Netlify deploy summary reads **"3 functions deployed"** (it currently says "No functions deployed"). If it still says none, the toml was not included in the drop. Then `/map.html`, allow location; Ask Grant + AI search should also start working for the first time.
- Files changed: `netlify.toml` (NEW), `js/map.js`, `css/styles.css`. Commit `FFP-MASTER.md` too.

## LATEST — 2026-07-18 (bi) — PUSH PIPELINE (task #176 DONE). Backend **v170→v171**. New cron `/api/cron/push-notifications`.
Grant: "push notifications for comments + likes on an activity card."
- **DIAGNOSIS (RULE 0, verified live):** the bell ALREADY works — `member_like_activity` and `member_comment_activity` both INSERT a `notifications` row. The gap is the PUSH: those RPCs are called **client-side straight to the DB**, so the backend (which owns web-push/FCM) never saw them and no phone push was ever sent. `notifications` had **no `pushed_at`** and no drain.
- **FIXED GENERALLY, not as a like/comment patch** (RULE 0.5): ANY `notifications` row now becomes a real push, so every current AND future notification type is covered and nothing can be added later that silently fails to notify.
- **DB (migration `notifications_push_pipeline`, LIVE):** `notifications.pushed_at timestamptz` + partial index `idx_notifications_unpushed (created_at) where pushed_at is null`. **SAFETY BACKFILL:** stamped all **2,877** existing rows as handled — without it the first cron run would have blasted 2,877 historical pushes at members. Verified queue = **0 unpushed**.
- **Backend (`index.js`, before `module.exports`):** new `GET /api/cron/push-notifications` — drains unpushed `audience='member'` rows created in the last **6h**, batch **200**, sending via the EXISTING **`sendPushToMember()`** (RULE 5 — it already handles web-push VAPID *and* native FCM; no second sender invented). Idempotent: `pushed_at` is stamped whether or not the member had a subscription (else a member with no device is retried forever). Anything older than the window is stamped so a backlog/outage can never fire hundreds of stale pushes.
- **`vercel.json`:** registered `{"path":"/api/cron/push-notifications","schedule":"*/5 * * * *"}` — 8 crons total, JSON validated (`JSON_OK`). 5-min granularity so a like/comment lands on the phone quickly.
- **VERIFIED:** `index.js` ends `module.exports = app;` at **L6912** (RULE 3.1); vercel.json parses and lists all 8 crons; notifications queue clean.
- **DEPLOY:** backend → Vercel; confirm `GET /` returns **v171** and the new cron appears in the Vercel cron list. Then have someone like/comment on an activity → the owner should get a phone push within 5 min.
- NOTE (#175 Trained With): verified the data model only — `activity_partners (activity_id, partner_member_id, tagged_by, status, created_at, updated_at)`, **19 rows / 19 activities**, displayed at shell L7299. The `status` column implies a two-way confirm. The exact status values + which RPC drives the confirm are NOT yet verified — do NOT describe the flow as fact until they are.

## LATEST — 2026-07-18 (bh) — ★ WHOOP FIXED AT SOURCE (task #173). Backend **v169→v170**. Duplicates merged LIVE.
Grant's two complaints, both root-caused and fixed at the source (RULE 0.5 — no patching).
**(1) Passport showed STALE WHOOP data badged "Today".** Proven live: last sync `2026-07-17 07:50Z` = **26h old**, latest metric day 17 Jul, today 18 Jul — yet the panel rendered it as "Today · from WHOOP". Cause: `renderTrendFitness` (shell ~L3333) used `latest(k)` which walked back through **up to 30 days per metric** and took the first non-null — so recovery could come from one day and HRV from another, all labelled Today.
- Backend `/api/wearables/daily` (L4249) now also returns each row's `updated_at`, plus `last_synced_at` (member_wearables), the member's `timezone`, and `server_now`.
- Shell now resolves the member's LOCAL today (from the server-supplied tz + server clock, never the device's), takes **only that day's row**, and renders it **only if refreshed within 60 min**. Otherwise renders NOTHING. No cross-day mixing, ever. Verify: on Grant's account right now the panel must be EMPTY (sync is 26h old).
**(2) WHOOP added a DUPLICATE card for a session already logged by hand.** Cause: `whoopUpsertActivity` deduped on `external_id` ONLY, which can never match a manual entry. Live scan found **21 overlapping pairs across 3 members**.
- **Source fix** (`whoopUpsertActivity`, backend L3800): (1) external_id lookup now has **no source filter** — an enriched manual row carries the external_id so re-syncs update THAT row; (2) new **`whoopFindManualMatch()`** — if the member already logged the session, **ENRICH it** via new **`whoopMeasuredOnly()`** (HR, calories, distance, strain/zones into `metrics`, `verified=true`) instead of inserting a second row; (3) only a genuinely new session inserts. **The member's activity name, photos, notes and venue are NEVER overwritten** — their entry stays theirs, the watch just adds data.
- **MATCH RULE (Grant-approved, derived from the 21 real pairs):** *(intervals overlap AND durations within 35%)* **OR** *(starts within 90 min AND durations within 10%)*. The 90-min clause exists because manual start times are approximate — Grant's 11 Jul pair was 66 min apart with an identical 19-min duration. Both clauses REQUIRE a duration match, which is what keeps genuinely different back-to-back sessions apart.
- **Existing data merged** (migration `whoop_merge_duplicate_activities`, LIVE): **20 pairs merged**, member's row kept + enriched, WHOOP row deleted. Full backup in **`activity_logs_whoop_dedupe_backup`** (whoop_id, kept_manual_id, all measured values) → reversible. Verified: **0 merged rows still present**; rows 323→304. Kept names prove intent: "Football (soccer)" not "Soccer", "Functional Fitness Competition" not "Functional training", "Treadmill" not "Running".
- **Correctly NOT merged (2 remaining overlaps):** Sunjay's 60-min lift vs 35-min walk (42% apart) and 30-min hike vs 15-min ruck (50% apart) — real separate sessions. Streaks unchanged after merge: Grant 46 · Sunjay 39 · ayanlike 5.
- **VALIDATION:** match rule + enrich payload unit-tested in isolation → **10/10** (5 real duplicates merge; 5 keep-separate cases hold, incl. two 30-min runs 3h apart and never matching another whoop row). Backend file verified to end **`module.exports = app;` at L6868** (RULE 3.1 — bash `node --check` again hit the stale-mount truncation at L6801 and is a FALSE error).
- **DEPLOY:** backend `index.js` → Vercel (**BACKEND_VERSION v170**, confirm `GET /` returns v170) + commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html`. DB merge is already live.

## LATEST — 2026-07-18 (bg) — COACH AL HUB = THE CONVERSATION. `ffp-coach-loader.js ?v=525→526`.
Grant: "remove the July activity quest details, remove the +Log activity and Meetups buttons... the 'open conversation' should not be needed as the remainder should be the conversation."
- **Hub is now ONE screen:** header → short coach read (streak/recovery strip, headline, line, 5-pillar numerals) → **the live thread** → composer pinned at the bottom. REMOVED: the July-race/quest block, the Log activity + Meetups action row, and the "Open full conversation" link.
- **The separate chat overlay (`#ffp-coach-ov`) is DELETED** — there is nowhere else to go. `C.openChat`/`C.closeChat` remain as thin aliases to `openHub`/`closeHub` so a legacy caller or an old cached shell still lands correctly. Removed the now-dead `C._pending` hand-off and `C.hubSend`.
- New `loadThread()` pulls `/api/coach/history` into `#ffp-coach-thread` inside the hub (greets via the hook if empty). `scrollBottom()` now scrolls the hub BODY (`#ffp-coach-hub-body`) since summary+thread share one scroller. `C.send()` unchanged — it already targets `#ffp-coach-input`/`#ffp-coach-thread`, which now live in the hub.
- Onboarding branch hides the composer (`#ffp-hub-composer`) until setup completes, then rebuilds the summary+thread shell and renders the conversation.
- Verified: file ends `})();` (L333), no dangling refs to `hubSend`/`ffp-hub-input`/`ffp-coach-ov` (Grep). Bash `node --check` again hit the known stale-mount truncation (RULE 3.1) — trusted Read/Grep per protocol.
- Deploy: commit `assets/ffp-coach-loader.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (script tag L8578 now `?v=526`, header comment updated).

## LATEST — 2026-07-18 (bf) — ★★ STREAK COLLAPSE (41→11) ROOT CAUSE: LOCAL WALL-CLOCK STORED AS UTC. Repaired LIVE + made structurally impossible.
Grant: "I had a 41 day streak and then suddenly it changed". **Nothing was deleted.** Activities were filed on the WRONG DAY.
- **ROOT CAUSE:** some `activity_logs.logged_at` values had the member's **LOCAL wall-clock written as if it were UTC**. Grant is `Asia/Makassar` (UTC+8), so an evening session entered as 18:15 was stored `18:15Z` = **02:15 the NEXT local day**. Every affected row was a late-afternoon/evening session (16:02, 16:30, 16:33, 18:15, 19:15) landing at 00:02–03:15 next-day local. His 6 Jul walk became 7 Jul → phantom gap on 6 Jul → a ~46-day chain truncated to 11.
- **EVIDENCE (not theory):** `member_action_log.action_day` (written by the quest engine at insert) recorded the TRUE day — 2026-06-20 / 06-25 / 07-06 — while `activity_logs` said 21/26/07. Independent corroboration, so the repair was evidence-based, not guesswork.
- **REPAIR (migration `fix_activity_logs_local_wallclock_stored_as_utc`, APPLIED LIVE):** re-interpreted the stored wall-clock in the member's own tz — `(logged_at at time zone 'UTC') at time zone member_tz`. **Only** rows where the correction lands EXACTLY on the recorded `action_day` were touched → **11 rows / 3 members**. 3 further mismatches (2 Asia/Dubai, 1 Africa/Nairobi) were deliberately EXCLUDED — they are back-dated entries (logged days later), a different thing; "fixing" them would have corrupted good data. Every original value saved to **`activity_logs_tz_fix_backup`** (fully reversible). **Grant's streak: 11 → 46. VERIFIED LIVE.**
- **STRUCTURAL FIX (migration `activity_local_date_single_source_of_truth`, LIVE)** — so it cannot recur: the "day" was previously re-derived at READ time by every feature separately, so any bad timestamp silently moved it. Now: new column **`activity_logs.activity_local_date` (date)**, computed SERVER-SIDE in the member's tz by trigger **`trg_activity_logs_local_date`** on INSERT/UPDATE — so NO write path (app, WHOOP, coach, or a backfill script) can bypass it. Backfilled all **323** rows (0 null). Index `idx_activity_logs_member_local_date`. **`member_activity_streak` now reads `activity_local_date`** (same rules: strict consecutive, no make-up save, alive if last activity is today or yesterday).
- **WRITE-PATH FIX** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (~L6856): was `new Date(dateStr+'T'+timeStr+':00').toISOString()` — converts via the **DEVICE's** timezone, so a phone in a different zone to the member wrote the wrong instant. Now **`window._ffpLocalToUtcIso(dateStr, timeStr, member.timezone)`** converts the entered wall-clock using the **MEMBER'S OWN** timezone (Intl offset technique; falls back to device tz then naive, so no regression). **Unit-tested 9/9** incl. Grant's exact 6 Jul case, 23:45 + 00:30 midnight edges, London BST/GMT, and the ambiguous US DST fall-back hour. ⚠️ NOTE: I first wrote those comment lines with `\` instead of `//` — invalid JS that would have killed the whole app; caught and corrected before hand-over (RULE 3.1 class of error).
- **GUARD RAIL (migration `activity_day_drift_integrity_check`, LIVE):** function **`ffp_activity_day_drift()`** returns any row with a missing local date, a local date out of sync with `logged_at`, or disagreeing with the quest `action_day`. Current state: **0 missing, 0 out-of-sync**, 3 known back-dated rows flagged for review. RUN THIS AFTER EVERY BACKFILL/IMPORT — the system now catches day-drift instead of a member noticing a broken streak.
- **PLATFORM-WIDE AUDIT + MY OWN OVER-CORRECTION (2026-07-18, migration `revert_overcorrected_whoop_and_coach_rows`, LIVE).** Grant: "fix platform... not just my account". Audited ALL 28 suspect rows (local time 00:00–06:00) across 6 members:
  - ⚠️ **I initially repaired 11 rows but 3 were WRONG.** I had treated `member_action_log.action_day` as independent evidence — it is NOT (it is derived; `quest_record_action` sets `action_day=v_day`), so it agreed by coincidence. VERIFIED the other write paths and both are CORRECT: **WHOOP** (`whoopUpsertActivity` backend L3802/3815 parses WHOOP's zoned ISO → true UTC) and **coach** (`pro_workout_log_session` inserts `now()`). So 2 whoop + 1 coach row were already right and I shifted them. **REVERTED to their originals.** Final repair set = **8 rows, ALL `source='manual'`** — the one genuinely buggy path (device-tz conversion). Backup table now holds exactly those 8.
  - **The remaining 17 suspect rows are NOT bugs — deliberately left alone.** `sunjay@findfitpeople.com` (Africa/Nairobi) genuinely trains 04:50–05:41; his WHOOP rows (authoritative UTC) sit at the SAME local time as his manual entries, corroborating them. Same for ayman (05:40 football) + hmwells (05:45 gym), Asia/Dubai. **Blanket-shifting "suspicious" early-morning rows would have DESTROYED Sunjay's 39-day streak.** Rule going forward: only `source='manual'` rows written before the 2026-07-18 frontend fix are candidates, and only with corroboration.
  - **Platform state VERIFIED (all 11 members with logs):** Grant 46 · Sunjay 39 · ayanlike99 5 · albrough22 1 · mikebourne590 1 · rest 0 (genuinely inactive). `ffp_activity_day_drift()`: **0 missing local dates, 0 out-of-sync**; 3 back-dated rows flagged for review only.
- **Files/versions:** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (shell — no own `?v=`, serves fresh on commit; `FFP_BUILD` untouched at 592). DB migrations are LIVE, no deploy needed. **Grant must commit the shell** for the write-path fix to reach devices.

## LATEST — 2026-07-17 (be) — MEMBER: COACH AL REDESIGN — top-bar portrait icon → full-bleed hub + first-signup spotlight tour
Grant: move the coach off the Passport home into a top-bar icon that opens a full-screen full-bleed modal; rename is a no-op (already "Coach AL" in all rendered strings); on first signup Coach AL runs an interactive spotlight tour then hands into onboarding. Iterated live with Grant on the icon: rejected stick-figure runners → **premium gradient-shaded shoulders-up PORTRAIT of a woman + a man** (no box). De-boxed the hub (hairlines, not filled pills). Everything is in the LOADER (keeps the 1.8MB shell lean); shell edits are surgical.
- **`assets/ffp-coach-loader.js` → v2, cache-bust `?v=522→523`** (its OWN `?v=` on the script tag; FFP_BUILD untouched — Grant's rule). Rewrote:
  - `alMark(px)` = the reusable Coach AL portrait SVG (6 linearGradients, **per-instance unique gradient ids** via a counter so multiple renders never collide). Replaces the old "AL" monogram disc everywhere (hub header, chat header, tour card).
  - **`C.openHub()`** = full-bleed hub (`#ffp-coach-hub-ov`, `position:fixed;inset:0;#081420`, z100060, `.ffp-noscroll`): state summary (streak · recovery · July-race gap · pillar numerals on a hairline) + Coach AL's live line + inline composer (`hubSend` → opens the chat and sends the queued msg via `C._pending`) + "Open full conversation" + de-boxed Log activity / Meetups (hairline row). If `snapshot.onboarded===false` → renders onboarding (motivations quick-pick + goal) INSIDE the hub.
  - **`C.startTour()` / `_tourShow` / `tourNext` / `endTour`** = 13-step first-run spotlight. TRUE cut-out: a ring with `box-shadow:0 0 0 9999px rgba(4,10,16,.82)` dims everything except the target (full-screen dim div for no-target steps). Steps target REAL selectors (skip-if-missing): welcome → Passport nav → `#ffp-log-activity-btn` → Quests nav → Community nav (`panel-meet`) → `#ffp-coach-btn` → `#user-btn` → then OPENS the avatar menu (`user-menu.classList.add('show')`) and spotlights AI Coach / Workout Timer / Calorie Tracker / Earnings menu items → `#ffp-menu-settings` ("Connect your devices" — wearables live in Settings→Connected apps, there is no separate menu item) → "Set me up" → `openHub()` onboarding. Closes the menu on non-menu steps.
  - **`C._maybeTour()`** self-boot: if `!localStorage.ffp_coach_tour_seen` and snapshot `onboarded===false` → auto-run the tour after 900ms; also sets the top-bar attention dot when a fresh hook exists. `C.render()` is now a **safe no-op** (inline card gone).
- **`ffp-member-dashboard.html`** (shell — serves fresh on commit, no `?v=`): (a) topbar feedback button REPLACED by `#ffp-coach-btn` — boxless static portrait SVG (ids `*TB`) + gold `#ffp-coach-dot` (hidden) → `ffpCoach.openHub()`; (b) **Feedback moved into the avatar menu ABOVE Settings** (`FFPFeedback.open()`); Settings got `id="ffp-menu-settings"`; (c) Log Activity button got `id="ffp-log-activity-btn"`; (d) inline `#ffp-coach-mount` card **REMOVED** (only remaining `ffpCoach.render()` call at L3344 is try/catch-guarded → safe no-op); (e) coach loader `?v=522→523` (L8585) + header comment (L106).
- **VALIDATION (RULE 3.1):** the bash mount served a STALE/TRUNCATED copy of the loader (241→224 lines, inconsistent) → node --check threw a FALSE mid-string EOF. Verified instead: file ends `})();` (Read), no straight apostrophes inside single-quoted strings (Grep), balanced structure (Read), and node-checked the exact risky patterns (unique-id gradient concat + smart-quote step strings + last-step ternary) in a fresh /tmp file → **PATTERNS_OK + ran**. Shell edits were surgical Edit-confirmed replacements.
- **DEPLOY (Grant):** commit `assets/ffp-coach-loader.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + `FFP-MASTER.md`. Expect: top bar shows the two-person portrait (not the feedback bubble); tapping it opens the full-bleed hub; Feedback is in the avatar menu above Settings; a brand-new signup gets the spotlight tour. **Portrait is a vector illustration and fully swappable** — if you'd rather a real image, drop a PNG in and I'll wire it. Tell me if the portrait itself needs refining (it's `alMark()` in the loader + the `*TB` copy in the shell topbar).
- **2026-07-18 (be2) — ONE COACH PER MEMBER + real avatar FILES. `ffp-coach-loader.js ?v=523→524`.** Grant binned the hand-drawn characters (runners, then the two-person portrait) and required ONE coach that depends on the person. Also: I could NOT generate photoreal art — no image model, and the sandbox blocks every asset route (DiceBear API web_fetch timed out; **npm 403**, **pip 403 proxy**; the browser CDN render worked once then returned blanks twice, so it was NOT safe to ship). Delivered static files instead of a runtime dependency:
  - **NEW assets (committed files, not generated at runtime): `assets/coach-female.svg`, `assets/coach-male.svg`, `assets/coach-neutral.svg`** — clean circular gradient avatars (FFP blue→navy, light figure). Faces deliberately omitted (that's where the drawing failed); silhouette reads premium at 34px. **Swap these 3 files to change the character everywhere — no code change needed.**
  - Loader: `alMark()` no longer draws SVG — it returns `<img src=coachSrc()>`. New **`coachSrc()`** picks the file from `C._snap.gender` (checks female FIRST so 'female'.indexOf('m') can't misfire) → female / male / neutral fallback. New **`C._syncTopbar()`** swaps the top-bar `#ffp-coach-img` src once the snapshot lands (called from `_maybeTour` + `openHub`). Dead portrait function REMOVED (no cruft).
  - Shell: top-bar button now holds `<img id="ffp-coach-img" src="assets/coach-neutral.svg" width=34 height=34>` (boxless, gold dot retained); loader `?v=523→524` (L8585).
  - Verify on device: male-profile member sees the male avatar, female sees female, unknown/blank gender sees neutral.
- **2026-07-18 (be3) — ★ COACH AL = ALBA + LEO. Grant's own artwork adopted. `ffp-coach-loader.js ?v=524→525`, coach art `?v=1`.**
  Grant supplied **`Coach AL - Alba & Leo.dc.html`** (his character spec) — this SUPERSEDES my placeholder silhouettes. **AL = Alba (female coach) + Leo (male coach)**; one is shown depending on the member.
  - Extracted his `<g id="alba">` / `<g id="leo">` artwork + the exact avatar treatment from his spec: head crop **`viewBox="108 60 84 84"`**, 52px circle, Alba on `#dcefe8` with a **`#37E0C6` teal ring**, Leo on `#0f5257` with a **`#FFCC00` gold ring**.
  - **Files OVERWRITTEN (same filenames → zero wiring change): `assets/coach-female.svg` = ALBA, `assets/coach-male.svg` = LEO, `assets/coach-neutral.svg` = Alba w/ neutral blue ring** (default when gender unknown; to default to Leo instead just copy coach-male.svg over it).
  - Palette per his spec: Alba skin `#f5c090→#dd9a5f`, teal tank `#52ecd3→#21b39e`; Leo skin `#dc9c63→#b6773d`, coral tank `#ff937e→#eb5b45`, gold headband; shared hair `#3c3c48→#1d1d26`.
  - Loader: added **`COACH_ART = '1'`** — every avatar src is `assets/coach-*.svg?v=COACH_ART`, so swapping the artwork later cache-busts by bumping ONE constant. Shell top-bar img src likewise `?v=1`.
  - Character selection unchanged: `coachSrc()` off `snapshot.gender` (female checked first) → Alba / Leo / neutral.
- INCOMPLETE / not touched this turn: tasks #173 WHOOP, #174 Kickstart, #175 Trained With, #176 push notifs, #177 match score (still queued). Also from his spec but NOT yet wired: Alba/Leo **voice differences** (how each talks) and the pillars each owns — the coach copy is still single-voice; wire the persona into `/api/coach/chat` prompts when Grant calls it.

## LATEST — 2026-07-13 (ay) — FFP PRO: SHARED EXERCISE LIBRARY (Phase 2a — DB + coach picker LIVE/built)
Spec: `FFP-EXERCISE-LIBRARY-SPEC.md`. Mirrors the `benchmark_templates` pattern (professional_id NULL = FFP-official, else coach).
- **DB (APPLIED LIVE)** — migration `exercise_library_phase2a`: table `exercise_library` (id, professional_id→professionals, name, muscle_group, equipment, difficulty, default_mode, demo_url, thumb_url, default_cue, aliases, sort_order, active, created_at) + RLS `exercise_library_read` (global OR own OR is_admin) + RPCs (all SECURITY DEFINER, grant to authenticated): `exercise_library_list(p_professional,p_search,p_muscle,p_equipment)`, `exercise_library_save` (coach upsert, assert_pro_owner), `exercise_library_delete`, `exercise_library_admin_list` (is_admin), `exercise_library_admin_save` (is_admin). **Seeded 44 FFP-official exercises** (name/muscle/equipment/mode/cue; demo_url intentionally NULL — admin fills, not fabricated). Smoke-tested (count=44, Legs filter OK).
- **Coach app** `ffp-professional-client-loader.js`: "Add exercise" (line ~855) now → **`wkOpenExPicker()`** = full-screen library picker (search + muscle/equipment `<select>` filters via `exercise_library_list`; rows = name · muscle · equipment + teal play badge if demo; tap → `wkPickExercise` snapshots name/default_mode/default_cue/demo_url + exercise_library_id + muscle/equipment into `_wkDraft.exercises`). **New exercise** overlay (`wkNewExercise`/`wkSaveNewExercise`) → `exercise_library_save` (coach's own) + adds to the workout. No workout-table change. Picker block parse-validated in isolation (PICKER_BLOCK_OK); full-file node --check still hits the same 1112 mount-truncation false EOF (RULE 3.1) — file ends clean at renderMembers().
- **PRO_BUILD 139 → 140** (+ changelog). Also hardened the v139 "Watch how" chip fallback `#9b7bf0`→`#0a3e44` (the `--ffp-purple` var actually resolves to FFP teal; no purple in FFP Pro).
- **Deploy:** Grant commits `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` + `index.html` (FFP Professional app repo); confirm avatar menu shows **Build 140**; open a workout → Add exercise → pick one → it drops in with its cue/demo.
- **Admin curation panel — BUILT as its own LAZY LOADER** (Grant: must NOT be inline in the dashboard HTML): new file **`ffp-admin-exercises-loader.js`** (IIFE, `window.AdminExercises`, self-boots on load) registered in `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` `_panelScript['panel-exercises']='ffp-admin-exercises-loader.js?v=1'` + nav link "Exercise Library" (Platform) + empty `panel-exercises` section + `panelNames` entry. (First inline attempt was REVERTED.) render()→`exercise_library_admin_list` into a `.table` (name+cue, muscle, equipment, mode, demo ✓, status) with search + muscle filter + a count; Add/Edit via shared `openModal`+`.field-*` → `exercise_library_admin_save` upsert. Footer build **v58→v59**. Loader parse-validated (LOADER_OK). Deploy: Grant commits `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` + `ffp-admin-exercises-loader.js`.
- **LIBRARY SEED EXPANDED to 391 global exercises** (Grant: "as many as you can find across as many genres"): one guarded insert (dedupe by lower(name), professional_id is null) adding ~347 across strength (barbell/dumbbell/machine/cable/Smith), calisthenics/rings, kettlebell, olympic lifts, strongman/carries, plyometrics, core/ab, mobility/stretch/yoga, pilates, cardio/erg/conditioning, agility drills, boxing/MMA. Base info only (name/muscle/equipment/default_mode); demo_url + cue added over time. All mapped into the existing 9 muscle + 8 equipment vocab so the picker/admin filters stay coherent. **LIVE** (total_global=391).
- 2026-07-13 (az) admin panel WORLD-CLASS PASS (Grant: flat 391-row list "complete ASS"): `ffp-admin-exercises-loader.js` renderList now **groups rows** under section headers with counts (e.g. "ARMS · 28"), sorted alphabetically within each group; new **By muscle / By equipment toggle** (`_setGroup`, `_groupBy` state) + kept search + muscle filter. Loader `?v=1→2`, footer **v59→v60**. Grouped code parse-validated in isolation (EDITS_OK); full-file node --check hits the same mount-truncation false error (bash reads 95/123 lines) — file ends clean at `})();` (Read-verified). Deploy: Grant commits both files.
- 2026-07-13 (ba) contrast fix (Grant: dark text on dark bg): the custom-styled Group-by toggle rendered dark text without the yellow showing → rebuilt using the dashboard's OWN themed button classes (active `btn btn-primary`, inactive `btn btn-outline`, `_setGroup` swaps the class) so both are legible on dark; forced the panel `<h1>` to `color:var(--text)`. Loader `?v=2→3`, footer **v60→v61**. Toggle parse-validated (TOGGLE_OK). Deploy: Grant commits both files.
## LATEST — 2026-07-13 (bd) — ★★ REAL ROOT CAUSE of social-share points: BROKEN FOREIGN KEY (fixed LIVE, proven)
Grant: only his shares recorded; nobody else's. After days of wrong theories (display refresh, image-render, user_id, auth) the ACTUAL cause, found by RUNNING the pipeline (not theorising):
**`social_shares.member_id` had `FOREIGN KEY … REFERENCES auth.users(id)`** — but `log_social_share` inserts the **members.id**. So the INSERT only succeeded when a member's `members.id == their auth.users.id`, which is TRUE for Grant alone (his id == user_id). For every other member (id ≠ user_id, or no auth user — Mike, Two Test, all real members) the insert **violated the FK and was silently rejected** (swallowed by log_social_share + the frontend) → no `social_shares` row → no trigger → no `member_action_log` → no points. Identical code, different result = a DATA constraint, exactly as Grant argued.
FIX (migration `social_shares_fk_to_members`, **APPLIED LIVE**): dropped the FK, re-added `FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`. Verified: `mintSupabaseJwt` sets JWT `sub = members.id` so `assert_member_self` passes for every member (auth was never the blocker).
**PROVEN LIVE**: inserted a real share for **Two Test** (id ≠ user_id) → July quest points **27 → 30** (+3), `member_action_log` logged, then deleted the test rows + re-ran `quest_eval_auto` → restored to 27, zero residue.
**This is a DB fix — LIVE NOW, NO deploy needed.** Every member who shares from the currently-deployed app will now record + score. (The earlier frontend tweaks — log-before-image-render in `ffpDoShareCard`, silent accrual, `Quests.pokeLive` leaderboard refresh, `ffp-quests-core.js?v=27` — are separate robustness/UX improvements, still worth committing, but NOT required for shares to work.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-13 (bc) — QUEST "share points not adding" — ROOT CAUSE = display refresh, NOT the engine
Grant (10-15 reports): share points not adding in Quests. **DIAGNOSIS (live-verified): the DB engine is CORRECT.** Full chain traced: share → `log_social_share` → `social_shares` → trg `quest_after_social_share` → `quest_track`→`quest_record_action` (logs `member_action_log`, 252 social_share rows) → `quest_eval_auto` (points_race: sum `_quest_capped_count × points`) → `quest_progress.points`. RECONCILED every member vs a from-scratch recompute: **July Activity Quest 26/26 members, 0 mismatches** (247 capped share-days ≈ 741 share pts already credited); Team Quest same. So prior "fixes" kept touching a correct engine. Real gap = the **frontend only refreshed the Earnings tier stat, never the quest leaderboard/feed**, and the board only auto-refreshed every 45s → users never saw their points/position move.
FIX (frontend only, no DB/engine change):
- `assets/ffp-quests-core.js`: new **`Quests.pokeLive()`** (reloads the open leaderboard via `loadQuestBoard()` + re-fetches the feed via `load()`); board auto-refresh **45s → 15s** so positions tick live while watching.
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html`: call `Quests.pokeLive()` immediately after a **share** (`ffpLogSocialShare`), a **high-five** (`member_like_activity`), and a **comment** (`member_comment_activity`) so those points show on the leaderboard at once.
- `assets/ffp-build.js` **FFP_BUILD 592 → 593** (cache-busts ffp-quests-core.js). Validated: pokeLive parse-OK; full-file node --check hits the mount-truncation false EOF (RULE 3.1).
- Deploy: Grant commits `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js`; **the loader is cache-busted by its OWN `?v=` on the script tag — bumped `ffp-quests-core.js?v=26→27` (line 350)** (FFP_BUILD does NOT cache-bust it — that was the miss). 
- 2026-07-13 (bc2) RECORDING-layer findings (Grant: "Mike's shares not showing"): traced the current path `share tap → ffpLogSocialShare('passport') [fires unconditionally on tap, line 8352] → log_social_share → assert_member_self → social_shares insert → trigger → member_action_log + quest points`. Data: `social_shares` has ever recorded **only 1 distinct member** (the older 252 member_action_log shares came from a pre-`log_social_share` path). **Mike Bourne is a no-login SEED account** (`user_id` null; synthetic 1/day shares Jul 2–9 then nothing) → cannot generate a live share, so nothing new can show; his seeded shares ARE already in his 122 pts. Real logged-in members DO record (passport-share fires on every tap; assert_member_self passes for them as it does for their other RPCs). FIXES: (1) `log_social_share` daily cap **2→3** (migration `log_social_share_cap_align_3`, LIVE) so a real member's 3rd daily share isn't silently dropped; (2) `ffpLogSocialShare` now **surfaces the RPC error to console** (`[FFP share] log_social_share FAILED: …`) instead of swallowing — so any future real failure names itself. Verify with a REAL logged-in account (not a seed): share the Passport card → +3 on the quest board.
- 2026-07-13 (bc3) ★ REAL ROOT CAUSE of "no one's activity-share points allocate": in `ffpDoShareCard` (activity Share-card → "Share your activity" modal → Share), `ffpLogSocialShare('activity')` was called AFTER `_ffpCaptureShareCard()` — and the `if(!f){…;return;}` on a failed image export returned BEFORE logging. So any member whose share-card image didn't render (common on mobile) tapped Share and got NO social_share logged → no points. Grant's device renders fine → only his recorded (matches the data: 1 real sharer). FIX: moved `ffpLogSocialShare('activity')` to fire on tap BEFORE the image render, so a render hiccup can never rob the credit. (Passport share `sharePassportCard` was already correct — logs before its non-blocking pre-rendered file.) File: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (commit the shell). Also note the auth architecture is fine: app-JWT `sub=members.id`, so `assert_member_self` passes for EVERY logged-in member — `user_id`/no-auth was a red herring on my part. Verified the button routing: activity modal "Share" (line 7719) → `ffpDoShareCard` → `ffpLogSocialShare('activity')` — identical path for all members. Added VISIBLE confirmation in `ffpLogSocialShare`: success → "share points added" toast, capped → "maxed for today", RPC error → "couldn't record — try again" (+ console reason) — so recording is now self-evident and any residual failure names itself in one tap instead of silent. Deploy: commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html`.

## LATEST — 2026-07-13 (bb) — FFP PRO Phase 2b: FFP-HOSTED demo clips on Supabase Storage (built)
Grant: "Build phase 2 with supabase storage." Three layers, all verified:
- **Storage (LIVE)** migration `exercise_demos_bucket`: bucket **`exercise-demos`** (public read) + 4 storage.objects policies (read/insert/update/delete gated by bucket_id) mirroring the `team-images` pattern.
- **Admin upload** (`ffp-admin-exercises-loader.js`): the exercise form gains an **"upload an FFP clip (mp4/webm)"** file input + optional **poster** input. `save()` now uploads any chosen files to `exercise-demos` (`official/<slug>-clip|poster-<ts>.<ext>`), takes the public URL → `demo_url`/`thumb_url`, preserves existing thumb on edit, then upserts via `exercise_library_admin_save`. Paste-a-link still works (upload overrides). Loader `?v=3→4`, footer **v61→v62**. `SAVE_OK` in isolation.
- **Coach runner inline player** (`ffp-professional-client-loader.js`): `wkRunRender` now renders an **inline muted looping `<video>`** (with `thumb_url` poster) for direct-file clips (mp4/webm/ogg/mov/m4v), tap → full-screen `wkDemoOpen`; YouTube/Vimeo links keep the "Watch how" chip. `PRO_BUILD 140→141` + changelog. `INLINE_OK` in isolation.
- **Deploy:** Grant commits `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` + `ffp-admin-exercises-loader.js` (admin repo) and `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` + `index.html` (Pro repo). Confirm admin footer **v62** + Pro avatar **Build 141**.
- **INCOMPLETE / follow-ups:** (a) coach custom-exercise clip upload in the Pro "New exercise" form (coaches paste links for now); (b) service-worker caching of clips for weak-signal gyms; (c) the actual ~391 FFP clips (content production — admin uploads them over time). Egress note: if bandwidth climbs, move the bucket to Cloudflare R2 (zero egress) — `demo_url` is host-agnostic.

## LATEST — 2026-07-13 (ax) — FFP PRO WORKOUTS: per-exercise DEMO VIDEO + COACHING CUE (Phase 1, paste-a-link)
Grant: "FFP Pro workouts need a video demo link so people can view how to do an exercise." Approved Phase 1 (paste-a-link) after mockups; noted a shared FFP exercise library as Phase 2 (future spec).
Files (COACH app = **FFP Professional app** repo only — the coach client loader is not mirrored to the member Passport):
- `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` (workout builder + runner):
  - Exercise object gains **`demo_url`**; the existing `exercises[].note` is surfaced as the editable **"Coaching cue"** (was read-only). Threaded through `wkNorm`, `wkNewBlank`, `wkAddExercise`, and **`wkCollect`** (reads `[data-field="demo_url"]` + `[data-field="cue"]` from the DOM); preserved into **`wkLogToPassport`** (logged activity metrics.exercises).
  - Builder `wkRenderBuild`: added a "Demo video" link input (with `ffpInfoPop` info-icon) + a "Coaching cue" input per exercise.
  - Runner `wkRunRender`: lightweight **"Watch how" chip** per exercise that has a demo — **no video loads on the workout**. New **`wkDemoOpen`** builds a full-screen player ONLY on tap (`wkEmbed` → YouTube/Vimeo iframe or `<video>` for mp4; non-embeddable links `window.open` in a new tab) with the coach cue underneath. `wkDemoClose`.
  - **NO DB CHANGE**: `pro_workout_save` stores the `exercises` jsonb wholesale (verified live via pg_get_functiondef) — `demo_url`/cue persist automatically.
- `index.html`: **PRO_BUILD 138 → 139** (cache-busts the loader) + changelog v139.
- Validated: all additions parse clean in isolation (node --check SNIPPET_PARSE_OK); full-file node --check throws a FALSE EOF at line 1112 = the known mount-truncation boundary (RULE 3.1) — real file ends clean at line 1164 (verified via Read). **Deploy: Grant commits both files to the FFP Professional app repo; confirm avatar menu shows Build 139.**

## LATEST — 2026-07-13 (aw) — TEAM QUEST page: real crest LOGOS wired into podium + top-10 (curved wordmarks)
Grant: "Text should bend with shape where possible. Do this then just add to the page." (10 made-up team logos.)
File: `team-quest.html` (Building FFP Passport). NOT yet mirrored to FFP Professional app/team-quest.html — awaiting Grant OK.
- Replaced the old `.pcov`/`.plogo` icon-in-box podium treatment AND the `.lblogo` colored-box list icons with 10 bespoke inline-SVG **crests**, each a DISTINCT shape with gradient shading + an emirate scene + a white emblem glyph + a **curved team-name wordmark** (SVG `<textPath>` along a per-crest arc, `paint-order:stroke` outline for legibility).
  - Podium (no box; medal overlaps bottom-centre half-on via existing `.pmedal`): 1 Dubai Distance Project (pointed shield, dawn skyline+sun, run glyph, "DISTANCE") · 2 Capital Crushers (hexagon, brushed steel, "CRUSHERS") · 3 Al Ain Oasis OCR (rounded shield, sun+dunes, "OASIS OCR").
  - List 4–10: Sharjah Sabres FC (football shield) · Creek Touch Rugby (oval, your team) · Jebel Jais Rangers (mountain pennant) · Ajman Reef Runners (rounded square, waves) · Fujairah Freedivers (droplet) · UAQ Lagoon Paddlers (rounded shield) · Marina Barbell Club (octagon, chrome). List crests reuse the same SVGs; `.lblogo .crest .wm{display:none}` hides the wordmark at 46px (name already shows in the row).
- CSS: removed `.plogo`/`.lblogo` box rules; added `.pemblem .crest` (118px; first=150px) + `.lblogo` de-boxed (transparent, no shadow) + `.lblogo .crest` 46px. Points/order/active counts unchanged.
- Verified: file terminates `</body></html>` (line 440); crests render (shapes + curved text + glyphs) in isolation. **Deploy: Grant commits team-quest.html.** (No build constant on this static page.)
- 2026-07-13 (aw2) SCORING section edits (same file): (1) how-it-works split image src → **`site-images/quest-group-cheering.png`** (Grant's filename for the new celebratory crew photo). (2) heading "Every action climbs the board." → **"Log activity + Support Your Team."** (3) Score list: removed "Keep a streak" (NO streak task exists in quest_task_catalog — verified live), added **"Share on socials"** (social_share). (4) Added **points examples** (verified live from quest_task_catalog): Log an activity 5 · high-five 2 · comment 1 · Refer a friend 20–30 (monthly 20/annual 30) · Host or join a meet-up 20–30 (attend 20/host 30) · Share on socials 5. Points shown as yellow numerals right-aligned (`.sc .n`, no pill/box).
- 2026-07-13 (aw3) DATES + CTA (same file): competition window changed to **1 – 31 August 2026** (was 20 Jul – 31 Aug). Updated: hero flag "1 – 31 August 2026", hero note "1 – 31 August 2026. One live leaderboard." (was "Six weeks…"), stat strip "Aug / 1 – 31, 2026" (was "6 / Weeks"), DATES boxes "Now open / Registration", "1 August 2026 / Race begins", "31 August 2026 / Winners crowned", meta description. All 3 CTAs ("Enter your team" — nav, hero, CTA band) → **"Contact us to register"**, href now `mailto:hello@findfitpeople.com?subject=Team Quest registration` (was ffpprofessional.com/signup). Deploy: Grant commits team-quest.html.
- 2026-07-13 (aw4) polish: nav brand dot → gold medal emblem (`.bmark`, ffp-medal-gold.png). Removed floating hero medal (`.hero-medal`) + hero note line. **SCORING section rebuilt "world-class"** (Grant: "far too messy"): section now centered; the cramped 3-col point grid → a single airy **`.pts-list`** (max 580px, sorted by value desc: Refer 20–30, Meet-up 20–30, Log 5, Share 5, High-five 2, Comment 1; icon+label left, yellow numeral right, hairline dividers, no pills); the 4 filled `.fstep` **flow boxes removed** → boxless hairline strip (`.flow` with `border-left` dividers, matches the stats/spend pattern — no box soup). Mobile: `.flow` → 2-col. Rendered + approved by Grant ("go"). (aw5) scoring title adapted → "Log activity.<br>Support your team." (clean two-line, sentence case, matches page editorial style).
- 2026-07-13 (aw6) Grant: "leave a comment is 1 point and a high five is 0.5 of a point." team-quest.html scoring list now shows High-five **0.5 pts** (was 2) + reordered below Comment (1). ⚠️ DISCREPANCY: live `quest_task_catalog.high_five.points` is still **2** (column is `numeric`, so 0.5 is storable). Page ≠ engine — ASKED Grant whether to apply `high_five 2→0.5` live. **Grant chose: leave engine at 2** (no DB change). team-quest page intentionally shows 0.5; live scoring stays 2 until Grant decides otherwise.

## LATEST — 2026-07-11 (av) — QUESTS: award points for commenting on an activity (DB migration, LIVE now)
Grant: "add points to user for leaving a comment on someone's activity." Found BOTH pieces missing: no `comment` row in quest_task_catalog AND no trigger on activity_comments (only activity_logs + food_logs auto-scored).
Migration `quest_award_points_for_activity_comment` (applied LIVE):
- quest_task_catalog += code='comment', label 'Comment on an activity', icon chat_bubble, source 'self', **points 1, daily_cap 5** (cap stops spam-farming — high_five uses the same 5/day guard). Idempotent insert (skips if exists).
- `trg_quest_comment()` (SECURITY DEFINER, mirrors trg_quest_social_share/connection) → on AFTER INSERT of activity_comments, calls `quest_track(NEW.member_id,'comment',…)` **only when commenting on ANOTHER member's activity** (v_owner <> commenter → no self-farm). Swallows errors so commenting never breaks.
- trigger `quest_after_comment AFTER INSERT ON activity_comments`.
Scoring path (verified): quest_record_action matches catalog by `code`, enforces daily_cap via member_action_log, inserts points_base, runs quest_eval_auto. SMOKE-TESTED in a rolled-back DO block: comment on someone else's activity → member_action_log comment_action_rows=1, points_base=1; rollback left nothing.
NOTE: engine-level enablement. Points count in a quest ONLY if that quest's task list includes the "comment" task (add via Admin quest builder) — same as every catalog action. NO deploy needed (DB live); NO file/version bump (server-side only).
FOLLOW-UP (same turn): added the "comment" auto-task to the 3 live full-action quests via `quest_save_task` — July Activity Quest (aa292a57, task 62b8325f), Global Ambassador (cf0a0f6d, task 1e646b45), Team Quest (54c2c57e, task 48d8ea69). Each: proof_type='auto', points=1, rule={activity_type:'comment',target:1} (per-day cap from catalog=5, since `_quest_capped_count` caps per action_day). In quest_eval_auto points_race = capped_count × TASK.points. SKIPPED July Pair Quest (38ed4ded — 0 tasks, special avg-of-active). All 3 returned ok. LIVE now.

## LATEST — 2026-07-11 (ax) — Homepage consolidation: index.html completed from landing, ffp-passport-landing.html DELETED
Grant: "delete the landing file — I've been pushing landing content into index.html." VERIFIED FIRST (RULE 3.1): `index.html` was TRUNCATED on disk — ended at L346 mid-`<li>` tag (no closing `</ul>`, pricing CTA, CTA band, footer, or `</body></html>`). `ffp-passport-landing.html` was the COMPLETE version (373 lines); lines 1–345 byte-identical to index. FIX: `cp ffp-passport-landing.html index.html` → index now complete (373 lines, ends `</body></html>` L373, trial copy 14-day), then `rm ffp-passport-landing.html`. No references to the landing file remain anywhere. ⚠️ If a truncated index.html was previously committed, the live ffppassport.com homepage is cut off — committing this fixed index.html resolves it. DEPLOY: commit index.html (Netlify); landing file removal is local-only (was never committed).

## LATEST — 2026-07-11 (aw) — PASSPORT TRIAL 7 → 14 DAYS, platform-wide (BACKEND_VERSION v168→v169)
Grant: "change the passport trial to 14 day free trial, platform wide." DEEP REVIEW found the live trial was **7 days** (never 30 — that was only ever discussed). Changed every trial surface to 14, leaving unrelated "7-day" strings alone (JWT refresh, iOS localStorage eviction, calorie 7-day charts, wearable/activity windows, and the SEPARATE cancellation "14-day save").
Files (all in Building FFP Passport):
- **assets/…/backend index.js** — THE enforcement: `subscription_data.trial_period_days: 7 → 14` (L1971). Trial-ending email copy "your 7-day trial ends" → 14 (L1474). All spec comments (322/323, 671/916/961, 725, 1787 "7-day date", 1969) updated 7→14. BACKEND_VERSION 'v168'→'v169' (L560). node --check PARSE_OK, ends module.exports=app; L6791.
- **login.html** — signup badge "7 days free"→"14 days free", CTA "Start My 7-Day Free Trial"→14 (heading + JS re-enable at L552), subtext "Free for 7 days…"→14, v16 comment block.
- **ffp-passport-landing.html** — L230/339/364 "7-day free trial"→"14-day free trial".
- **about.html** — L208/209 "7-day free trial"→14.
- **assets/ffp-constants.js** — pricing-doc comments L2/L17 "7-day trial"→"14-day trial" (doc only; no numeric constant).
- **terms.html** — L165 subscription clause "following a 7-day free trial" → "14-day free trial" (legal copy). L141 "free trial classes" (partner venue premiere sessions) is UNRELATED — left.
- **index.html** — homepage copy L230/339 "7-day free trial" → "14-day" (this file mirrors the landing).
- **privacy.html** — NO trial reference (its "30 days" = data-request response SLA); no change.
Final sweep: 0 "7-day free trial / 7 days free / Free for 7 days" strings remain in any member-app HTML.
SKIPPED: ffp-member-dashboard.html L8966 is a stale code COMMENT ("7-day trial") — non-user-facing; not worth touching the 1.8MB file (shrink directive). Note for next member-app deploy.
BEHAVIOUR: only NEW signups get 14 days (Stripe sets trial length at subscription creation); members already 'trialing' keep their original 7-day — correct, no billing migration.
DEPLOY: Backend commit index.js → Vercel → root should show **v169** (this ALSO clears the standing v161→v168 gap). Frontend (Netlify/ffppassport.com) commit login.html + ffp-passport-landing.html + about.html + assets/ffp-constants.js. NO member-dashboard change.

## BACKEND DEPLOY GAP (flagged 2026-07-11) — LIVE v161 vs REPO v168
`ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/` root returns `version:"v161"` but repo `BACKEND_VERSION='v168'` (index.js L560; file ends `module.exports = app;` L6791). So endpoints added v162–v168 are NOT live — notably **/api/pro/signup (v166)** the standalone Pro signup page calls, /api/cron/coach-automations (v162), referral gating (v166), Coach-AL/ethos (v167/168). ACTION: Grant commit index.js → Vercel redeploy → confirm root shows v168.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (au) — FFP PRO ★ROOT-CAUSE: delete benchmark/skill (and delete team, remove athlete) did NOTHING (PRO_BUILD 136→137)
Grant: "delete a skill or benchmark — showing but NOT working." VERIFIED the DB is fine: `pro_benchmark_delete(p_pro,p_benchmark)` exists, correct predicate (id+professional_id), grants authenticated=X; JLT benchmarks all professional_id=ff83faf4=Grant's pro id; `pro_team_overview` passes the REAL `pro_benchmarks.id`. So server-side delete works.
ROOT CAUSE (client): `ffpConfirm` in index.html is PROMISE-based (buttons call `ffpConfirmResolve(true/false)` → resolves the promise; it does NOT call any `onOk`). But the team loader called `ffpConfirm({action:'Remove', onOk: go})` and never awaited → the confirm showed, user tapped Remove, and `go()` NEVER RAN. Broken for all 3 callers: delete team (L656), delete benchmark/skill (L703), remove athlete (L727).
FIX (`FFP Professional app/assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js`): all 3 → `ffpConfirm({danger,title,body,confirm}).then(function(ok){ if(ok) go(); })`. Benchmark delete `go()` now also checks `r.error` and surfaces the message (no silent no-op). Validated: no `action:`/`onOk:` remain; edited lines node --check OK; file ends `})();` L1039 (bash full-file parse = mount-lag false EOF ~L1010, RULE 3.1). `index.html` PRO_BUILD 136→137 + changelog. DEPLOY: commit index.html + assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js → confirm avatar menu shows Build 137, then delete a benchmark/skill.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (at) — FFP PRO: add coach's Passport CONNECTIONS onto a team (PRO_BUILD 135→136)
Grant: "bring in their connections from their passport" — TEAM add-athletes ONLY (his scope choice).
- DB (LIVE, migration `pro_passport_connections_read`): new SECURITY-DEFINER RPC `pro_passport_connections(p_pro uuid, p_team uuid default null)` — `assert_pro_owner(p_pro)`, resolves coach `members.id` via `professionals.member_id`, returns accepted `member_connections` as jsonb [{id,name,email,photo,city,has_passport,already_member}] (already_member = in pro_team_members for p_team). Returns [] if the coach has no linked Passport. GRANTed to authenticated/anon/service_role. SMOKE-TESTED with Grant's account: 11 connections, already_member correctly true for Duane/Hannah/Sunjay (on JLT), false for the rest.
- Frontend `FFP Professional app/assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js` — in `_showAddPlayerPage` added a "From your FFP Passport connections" section (`#ap-conn-list`) below "Add from your clients". New `_renderApConn(q)` mirrors `_renderApList` exactly; fetches the RPC after the clients list; ONE search box (`teamApFilter`) now filters both; `teamApAdd` marks Added in BOTH lists. Adds via the existing `pro_team_add_member` (dedupes). Empty/no-Passport → "needs an active FFP Passport" note. Search placeholder "Search clients"→"Search people".
- `FFP Professional app/index.html` — PRO_BUILD 135→136 (+ changelog). VALIDATED: edited block node --check OK in isolation; file ends `})();` at L1039 (bash full-file parse = mount-lag false EOF at 1014, ignore per RULE 3.1). DEPLOY: commit index.html + assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js (FFP Professional repo) → confirm avatar menu shows Build 136.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (as) — REMOVED fake Passport Team/Club/Squad demo data (functionality kept)
Grant: "remove the fake data, not the functionality." DELETED (LIVE, one transaction) the club-competition/squad DEMO seed:
- 98 fake `members` (email ilike '%@ffpdemo.test') → cascaded activity_logs/quest_progress/etc.
- 8 demo `pro_teams` (description='seed-demo': Dubai Dragons, Desert Hawks, Al Khail Runners, Sandstorm CrossFit, Marina Strikers FC, Nomad Cyclists, Palm City Padel, Creek Swimmers) → cascaded pro_team_members/sessions/join_requests/benchmarks.
- 2,514 `member_action_log` rows for those fakes (deleted explicitly — member_action_log has NO FK cascade).
- 4 demo squads + 8 squad_members (cascaded via owner delete).
VERIFIED AFTER: fakes 0, seed-demo clubs 0, squads 0. KEPT: real team **JLT Touch Training** (70e34451, 2 real members Grant+Duane), 13 real pro_clients, member_action_log 722 (real). Features (Team/Club competition, Squad Quest, Pro Teams) all left in place — leaderboards simply empty until real users join.
NOTE: pro_clients (13) are ALL REAL people (Grant, Duane, Bazz, Sunjay, Ayman…) — NOT touched. The only remaining FAKE "client/member" batch = the **112 `provider_members` promo-screenshot seed** (notes='seed-2026-07-10') on the PARTNER/"Find Fit People" venue dashboard + its fake attendance/appointments/bookings — awaiting Grant's decision to remove.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (ar) — Partner pricing → Business section FREE FOREVER ($0/month)
`Projects/FFP Booking Platform/partner.html` — Business-section pricing card changed from "$99/month, first 2 months free" to **"$0 / month · Sign up now — free forever"**; check-line "Flat monthly fee"→"No monthly fee — keep 100% of what you bill"; section sub, footnote (pr-note), FAQ ("What does the Business section include?" → free forever) and BOTH meta descriptions (name + og) all updated to drop $99/monthly-fee wording. Engagement section unchanged (8% per marketplace booking). DEPLOY: commit partner.html (FFP Booking Platform repo → findfitpeople.com).

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (aq) — Pro landing: pro-signup side-padding root fix + member-view phone added to shots scroll
- `Projects/FFP Professional app/pro-signup.html` — ROOT CAUSE of the "fields touch the edges" (6 failed attempts): `.panel` set `padding:… 0 …` (zero horizontal) in BOTH the base rule (was `36px 0 20px`) AND the mobile `@media(max-width:560px)` rule (was `26px 0 14px`), overriding `.wrap`'s `0 22px`. Fixed to `36px 22px 22px` (base, line 72) and `26px 20px 14px` (mobile, line 135). Prior attempts only touched `.field` margins → never worked. DEPLOY: commit pro-signup.html (FFP Professional repo).
- `Projects/FFP Professional app/landing.html` — added a 7th figure to the `.shots` scroll: the member-facing coach-profile phone, `<figure class="shot device">` src `site-images/ffp-pro-member-view.png`, caption "Your profile · Passport / How clients find & book you." New CSS `.shot.device img{object-fit:contain;background:transparent;border:none;border-radius:0}` so a full iPhone-frame mockup shows whole (the other 6 are flat screens dressed by CSS). onerror hides the figure if the image is missing. ACTION FOR GRANT: upload the phone mockup to storage at exactly `site-images/ffp-pro-member-view.png` (transparent-bg PNG best). DEPLOY: commit landing.html.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (ap) — Partner landing (findfitpeople.com/partner) hero → dashboard CAROUSEL
`Projects/FFP Booking Platform/partner.html` — the single hero showcase image ("One dashboard to run and grow your facility") is now a crossfading, auto-advancing (3.8s) CAROUSEL with clickable dots, cycling 4 laptop-framed screens (all in site-images): partner-dashboard-overview.png → ffp-partner-appointments.png → ffp-partner-timetable.png → ffp-partner-events.png. Self-contained inline `.pr-carousel` (aspect 8/5, object-fit contain, drop-shadow) + tiny IIFE. DEPLOY (FFP Booking Platform repo → findfitpeople.com): commit partner.html.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (ao) — Passport home: WHOOP to top, streak strap removed, Coach Grant → Coach AL (+ better coach)
Member Passport (ffp-member-dashboard.html) — Grant approved (plan-first). (A) WHOOP daily block (`#trend-fitness`) MOVED from under the coach card to the TOP of Your Journey (right under the journey header, above hero-stats) — same JS fills it by id, behaviour-safe. (B) Removed the big streak STRAP only: deleted `#ffp-streak-mount` div + the `assets/ffp-streak-loader.js` script tag (kept the header flame badge + coach streak pill per Grant "A - just the big strap card"). (C) COACH GRANT → **COACH AL** (Active Lifestyle): renamed in `assets/ffp-coach-loader.js` (card + onboarding + chat header + greetings; avatar monogram G→AL), coach loader ?v=521→**522**.
BACKEND (index.js, Grant deploys): replace_all "Coach Grant"→"Coach AL" (card line, chat, nudges, push title, email "From Coach AL", onboarding headline). BETTER COACH: appended a directive to `FFP_ETHOS` (the shared coaching brain) — always use first name, reference something SPECIFIC/real (a logged session, favoured sport/place, streak, neglected pillar, quest standing), ONE concrete action for TODAY, point at a real meet-up/class/person nearby, end with a short question/challenge, one idea per message. `BACKEND_VERSION v167→v168`.
DEPLOY: Passport repo → commit ffp-member-dashboard.html + assets/ffp-coach-loader.js. Backend repo → commit index.js (v168).

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (an) — Provider promo: appts for new coaches + availability + blocks; timetable card tint
Provider "Find Fit People" (2fc1da8a). Grant added 3 more coaches (Lee Carter fa8a754c, Mike Bourne 464c510f, Phil Elder f8bb1c51) → seeded ~86–96 appointments each (same pattern, notes='seed-2026-07-10'), all 6 coaches now busy (3–6 today each). AVAILABILITY seeded into `provider_trainer_slots` (74 rows: all 6 coaches × Mon–Sat × morning 06:00-12:00 + evening 16:00-20:00, status active; slot_time NOT NULL so set = start_time). BLOCKS into `provider_trainer_blocks` (12 = 2/coach: recurring Wed 12:00-14:00 'Admin / lunch' + one upcoming date 09:00-12:00 'Personal'). Day-view calendar now shows yellow available bands + grey blocks per coach. Cleanup: `provider_trainer_slots`/`provider_trainer_blocks` where provider_id=2fc1da8a (venue had none before). NB provider_id needed ::uuid cast in the UNION.
UI: partner timetable session cards now `background:var(--ffp-bg-3)` (subtle #eef1f3 tint on light theme; was pure white --ffp-bg-2). scheduling loader ?v=24→**25**. DEPLOY: commit index.html + ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (am) — PARTNER app (partner.findfitpeople.com) UX: full modals, AM/PM timetable, scrollable calendar, duplicate session time
Repo: `Projects/FFP Partner app`. Four Grant asks:
1) **ALL MODALS FULL-SCREEN** — single source `openModalShell` (index.html:5586) + `.modal` CSS made `position:fixed;inset:0;100dvh;flex-column` (all sizes lg/sm/full now 100vw), sticky head + foot, body flex-scroll, BIG back arrow (left) + big close (right, 44px/24px icon), content capped `.modal-body-inner max-width 860px` for readability. Every modal in the app inherits this.
2) **TIMETABLE split AM/PM** — `renderTimetable` (ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js) now renders TWO 7-day grids: "Morning · AM" (hour<12) + "Afternoon & evening · PM" (≥12); each day column `max-height:360px;overflow-y:auto` (scrollable).
3) **APPOINTMENTS day calendar scrollable** — day view wrapped in `#ap-day-scroll {overflow:auto;max-height:62vh}` with a STICKY coach header, and auto-scrolls to 6am on open (`scrollTop=6*_AP_HH`) instead of showing empty midnight hours.
4) **DUPLICATE a session time** — weekly-schedule rows (`_tplAddSlotRow`) got a copy button → new `_tplDupSlotRow(btn)` clones day/time/coach into a fresh row.
Cache-bust: `_provLoaderSrc` scheduling ?v=23→**24**, appointments ?v=14→**15**. index.html tails intact; scheduling loader ends line 775 (bash node-check false EOF at 748 = mount lag, RULE 3.1). DEPLOY (partner repo): commit index.html + ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js + ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (al) — Provider promo seed FULL (revenue/check-ins/appointments/memberships) + landing scroll/CTA
FULL provider-dashboard promo seed for "Find Fit People" (provider_id 2fc1da8a-…) so every Overview/Analytics/Check-ins/Appointments screen is populated for screenshots. Driven by RPCs `provider_overview` + `provider_business_report` (read this turn). Seeded:
- **provider_attendance** 456 present rows across the 58 sessions in the last 30d → checkins_7d **124**, active_members_7d **85** distinct, class-fill + top-sessions + members-at-risk all populated. member_id = seeded provider_members.id (NO FK — allowed; RPC LEFT JOINs provider_members OR members).
- **provider_payments** 168 paid rows over 84d → revenue_month **AED 10,193**, 12-week revenue chart full, 88 distinct payers.
- **provider_appointments** 63 rows across the 3 coaches (Barry/Grant/Julie), -10..+10 days → appts_today **3**, appts_upcoming 31. member_id = REAL members.id (FK to members). notes='seed-2026-07-10'.
- **provider_member_plans** 74 active (plan_id=gen_random_uuid, no FK) → 53 expiring in 30d.
GOTCHA (again): `order by random() limit 1` in a lateral CACHES → all rows got 1 member (attendance collapsed to 60 via unique(session_id,member_id); payments all one name). FIXED with deterministic `mem.rn = 1 + (abs(hashtext(key)) % count)` per-row indexing. Also `provider_overview()` can't be called as service-role (assert_provider_owner → forbidden) — verified KPIs with raw SQL instead.
MORE (Grant "fill up appointments + sessions"): re-seeded **provider_appointments → 283** (3 coaches × 6 slots [7,9,11,14,16,18] × days −7..+14, ~70% kept for natural gaps; 15 today). TIMETABLE badge = **bookings** where item_type='provider_session' + item_id=session.id (from `provider_session_roster`/`provider_list_sessions`, window start_at ≥ now−1d), NOT attendance — so seeded **bookings 475** across 36 upcoming sessions (now−1d..now+14d) at ~75–100% capacity, member_id=real members. Timetable badges now show X/cap.
REVERSIBILITY: attendance/payments/plans → `member_id in (select id from provider_members where notes='seed-2026-07-10')`; appointments + session bookings → `notes='seed-2026-07-10'`; the 112 members → `provider_members.notes='seed-2026-07-10'`.
LANDING (this turn): capabilities scroll → 6 screens **Overview/Schedule/Clients/Teams/Track·Passport/Engage·Passport** + left scroll inset (padding-left 32px). "Ready when you are" CTA band now has photo bg = `ffp-pro-ready-when-you-are.png`. Overview/Clients scroll screens now wired to the REAL uploads `ffp-pro-overview-page.png` + `ffp-pro-client-detail.png` (Grant uploaded them). Section copy: eyebrow "What you do"→**"What's inside"** (nav + footer links too), sub "Real screens… swipe through"→**"Swipe to see your dashboard."** pro-signup mobile side padding restored to 22px (fields were touching edges).

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (ak) — Pro signup MOBILE hardening + provider promo seed (112 members)
1) `FFP Professional app/pro-signup.html` — MOBILE priority pass: added `@media(max-width:560px)` (tighter nav/hero/bene spacing, single-col rows, code input letter-spacing 9px so 6 digits fit narrow screens, `.prof-list max-height:40vh`, bigger tap targets) + iOS safe-area (`env(safe-area-inset-*)` on nav + foot). Profession picker now `scrollIntoView` the field on open (search+list sit above the keyboard). DEPLOY: commit pro-signup.html.
2) DB SEED (promo screenshots) — provider "Find Fit People" (provider_id 2fc1da8a-2b1c-46a0-950d-b0ece0f37066, owner providers@findfitpeople.com): provider_members 3 → **112** (added 109). Realistic Dubai-centric diverse names, member_status='active', tags (Member/PT client/Class pass/Member · Referral), join_date spread over ~180d. ALL seeded rows marked `notes='seed-2026-07-10'` → removable with `delete from provider_members where provider_id='2fc1da8a-…' and notes='seed-2026-07-10'`. NOTE: first attempt cached random() (all "Chloe Bakr") — deleted + re-seeded with n-indexed picks (112 distinct names). Bookings KPI still real (12) — provider_members is a standalone CRM (no members FK); boosting bookings/revenue would need platform member_ids (offer pending).

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (aj) — FFP PRO landing.html REBUILT — mobile-first, image-led, community voice
Grant: old landing was word-heavy + wrong positioning. New north star (locked): "FFP Pro helps coaches/trainers SUPPORT THEIR COMMUNITY" — coach is the hero, FFP the support; warm, not salesy, not competitor-baiting. Benchmarked against Teamer/TrueCoach/Trainerize (bold short headline, one CTA, product-forward imagery, checklist). Approved hero line: **"Everything you need to support your community."**
`FFP Professional app/landing.html` (v2) — REPLACES the old wordy landing. Mobile-first single ~440px column, teal (#0e2f3d) + yellow CTA, Montserrat. Sections: nav (logo + Sign in→/app + Join free→/signup) → full-bleed hero (image + scrim + H1 + CTA→/signup + "Free for coaches & trainers · Keep 100%") → 4 boxes **Coach / Manage / Track·Passport / Engage·Passport** (screenshots) → "Your coaching, in their pocket" (Passport phone) → "Always free. You keep 100%." → **benefits checklist "Everything you get"** (9 ticked items incl. referral rewards *with a Passport*) → close (image + "Ready when you are." + Join free) → footer. Almost no prose.
IMAGERY = real Supabase `site-images` (public), all swappable by filename: hero=phone-between-set.png; Coach=pro-ffp-coach.png, Manage=ffp-pro-schedule.png, Track=ffp-passport-fitness-stats.png, Engage=ffp-passport-connections.png; pocket=ffp-passport-coach.png; close=passport-gym-dumbell.png; logo=ffp-logo-white.png. INTERIM picks to review: a true coach-with-group HERO shot; a QUESTS screenshot for Engage (none in storage yet); a group CLOSE shot.
v3 (same day): app screenshots now render in PORTRAIT PHONE FRAMES (was landscape crops) — shared `.phone` frame, boxes aspect 9/17, pocket 9/19. PEOPLE-first photos (Grant: "people connect with people"): hero=passport-on-stepper.png, close=meetup-barbell.png (both INTERIM — confirm they show people; activity-photos bucket has 193 real member shots if better). Added a PROPER FOOTER (brand + tagline + Join free; columns Professional / Find Fit People; legal row Terms/Privacy/Support + © 2026).
v4 (Grant image/copy pass): tagline FIXED to the ONE FFP tagline **"Your Active Lifestyle Community."** (footer; do NOT invent others). Real screens wired: Coach=ffp-pro-team-overview.png, Manage=ffp-pro-schedule.png, Track=ffp-pro-team-athlete.png, Engage=ffp-passport-quest-team.png. Hero=**race-group.png** (⚠ NOT YET in site-images — Grant must upload it as race-group.png; wired + ready). "Your coaching, in their pocket" now a LANDSCAPE photo = phone-between-set.png (was portrait phone frame). Free band "Always free / keep 100%" → **"Easy for you, fun for them."** (single line).
v5 (final image/copy pass): hero=**race-group-photo.jpg** (real, in site-images). ALL "keep 100%" text REMOVED (Grant: pointless/confusing) — hero trust line now just "Free for coaches & trainers"; checklist line now "Scheduling, bookings and payments". Engage sub → "Compete against other teams." Diff line → "Athletes, players and clients connect to you through their FFP Passport." CLOSE image = the padel high-five (was on ffppassport.com as local `assets/padel-high-five.jpg`, NOT in Supabase) → COPIED into `FFP Professional app/assets/padel-high-five.jpg`, close img src=`/assets/padel-high-five.jpg`. FOOTER audited: removed fake "How it works"; Facilities → partner.findfitpeople.com (confirm live); real = Sign in/Join free/Create account/FFP Passport/Terms(ffppassport.com/terms.html)/Privacy(privacy.html)/Contact(hello@findfitpeople.com).
v6 (Grant: "upgrade the Professional page to the same STANDARD as the proper Passport page"): REBUILT modelling `ffp-passport-landing.html` — full RESPONSIVE marketing site (was a thin 440px mobile-only column; that's why phones didn't fit + benefits looked bare). Now: sticky nav (logo+links+Join free), full-bleed HERO (race-group-photo, 60px H1, lead + 2 CTAs), teal SUMMARY band (the toolkit paragraph), CAPABILITIES = 4 phone shots at aspect 9/19 object-position top (proper fit) Coach/Manage/Track·Passport/Engage·Passport, POCKET 2-col (landscape phone-between-set + ticked list), EASY band, BENEFITS = pricing-style CARD (rainbow band, big "Free", 9 ticks, **full-width CTA button** + fine print — fixes "3 benefits/no CTA"), CTA band "Ready when you are.", 3-col FOOTER (real links only). .wrap 1160px, responsive breakpoints 860/820/720/640/560. Teal palette (bg #07202a, accent #5ec8d8, yellow CTA).
Ends </html> (verified). DEPLOY (Pro repo → ffpprofessional.com): commit `landing.html` + `assets/padel-high-five.jpg`. (race-group-photo.jpg already in storage.) CTAs point /signup + /app.

## LATEST — 2026-07-10 (ai) — FFP PRO: standalone free SIGNUP page (ffpprofessional.com/signup) + landing CTAs wired
Grant: "sign up should be on ffpprofessional.com so people know exactly where to go." The Pro landing CTAs all pointed to a DEAD url (ffppassport.com/professional-signup.html — never existed). The Pro app already contains the full free-signup engine (email→code→onboarding→professional_link status=active, v134) but the only door was the /app "Sign In" gate, which BLOCKS new emails (requestCode 'signin' → "No account… get your Passport first").
BUILT (all in `FFP Professional app/`, same origin as /app + /landing):
MODEL (Grant, locked): Passport members = PAYING customers. Coaches/pros use FFP Pro FREE. Referral earning is OPTIONAL and needs a paid Passport on the SAME email (layered onto the same members row later). One account per email.
- NEW `pro-signup.html` (v3, renamed from signup.html so it's clearly the PRO one, distinct from partner signup.html) — self-contained, teal/yellow brand matching landing.html. Passwordless, REUSES the app's TAXONOMY + RPC (RULE 5): step1 given+surname+email + **MAIN PROFESSION via the FFP taxonomy searchable picker** (`FFP_TAX.professionalRolesFlat()`, world-class — inline fallback + refresh on `ffp-tax-ready`) + Country/City (`FFP_TAX.cities` cascade) → **POST `/api/pro/signup` {email,full_name}** (dedicated FREE endpoint, below); step2 6-digit code → `FFPApi.verifyCode(email, code)` (→ /api/auth/signin, sets token/member/jwt + Supabase session) → **`professional_link(p_member, {professional_types,category,country,city,…})`** (SAME RPC /app onboarding calls — signup is the COMPLETE single front door, no re-entry) → redirect `/app` → dashboard. Fallback: if professional_link errors, still redirect /app (onboarding catches it). Honeypot + resend cooldown. Loads supabase-js + ffp-api-integration.js?v=12 + ffp-constants.js + ffp-taxonomy.js?v=12.
- BACKEND (Vercel repo, index.js) — NEW **`app.post('/api/pro/signup')`** (line ~1733) + `BACKEND_VERSION v166→v167` (line 560). DEDICATED, PAYWALL-FREE by design — does NOT touch `ALLOW_FREE_SIGNUP` (which gates the paid-member /api/auth/signup), so the member paywall and free-pro door can never collide. Idempotent: NEW email → create free members row (role=member, status=active, no Passport sub); EXISTING email (Passport member or prior account) → reuse that row, refresh access_code, email a code. Reuses generateCode + sendCodeEmail. This RESOLVES the earlier ALLOW_FREE_SIGNUP blocker — no env flag needed. File verified: module.exports=app at line 6790 (tail intact).
- `_redirects` — added `/signup  /pro-signup.html  200` (above /app). Old signup.html deleted.
- `landing.html` — all 4 CTA hrefs (nav "Join", hero "Join as a professional", pricing "Sign up free", final "Join as a professional") repointed dead-url → `/signup`. Verified 0 dead urls remain.
Verified: pro-signup.html ends </html> + `})();`; POST /api/pro/signup + verifyCode + professional_link all present. No PRO_BUILD bump (index.html unchanged; static pages, sw.js never caches HTML).
DEPLOY: (1) Pro repo → ffpprofessional.com: commit `pro-signup.html`, `_redirects`, `landing.html` (delete signup.html). (2) Backend (Vercel) repo: commit index.js (v167) so `/api/pro/signup` is live — the signup page needs it. No env changes required.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (ah) — Next-training card + modal date blocks: full yellow left panel + MONTH
Grant: modal date block was missing the MONTH; and Next-training summary card "could have yellow background behind the date" → showed mocks (A solid tile / B number chip / C full left panel) → Grant chose **Option C**.
Files (both in `assets/ffp-member-teams-loader.js`, self-busts via `?v=Date.now()` — no build bump):
- `_mtSessionsSection` (summary card): date column is now a **full-height yellow left panel** (`width:70px; background:var(--yellow,#FFCC00)`), weekday+day+month stacked in dark text (#7a5c00 labels, #082335 day). Card is `align-items:stretch; overflow:hidden` so the yellow fills edge-to-edge.
- `_mtSessionRow` (sessions modal): added `mo` (month short, uppercase); date block now stacks WEEKDAY / DAY / MONTH (was weekday+day only).
Tail verified `})();`. DEPLOY: commit `ffp-member-teams-loader.js` (single commit covers both).

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (ag) — FIX: team TRAINING not showing in Passport — stale cached teams module (no build file needed)
Grant: JLT training added, "Your teams" card opens but NO training inside. DIAGNOSIS: data is correct (JLT id 70e34451 = the id the
card opens with; member_my_teams returns team_id, matches sessions; member_team_sessions returns the 8 sessions; Grant on roster). The
current `ffp-member-teams-loader.js` HAS the training section (`_mtSessionsSection` + member_team_sessions fetch). Root cause: the
Community feed injected the teams module as `ffp-member-teams-loader.js?v=FFP_BUILD` — and since FFP_BUILD isn't bumped (Grant dropped
the build file), the device kept serving the OLD cached module from BEFORE training existed → card renders, no training.
- **`assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js`:** `ensureTeamsCarousel` now loads the teams module as `?v=' + Date.now()` — always the
  latest, fires once per session (carousel reuses window.FFPMemberTeams after), decoupled from FFP_BUILD. Stale-teams-module can't recur.
- **`ffp-member-dashboard.html`:** feed-loader tag bumped `?v=573→574` so this fix reaches devices.
LESSON re FFP_BUILD: it is NOT useless — it's the cache key for the LAZY-loaded modules (teams/team-quest/pair-quest loaders). Dropping
it freezes those modules on old cached copies. Where practical, switch lazy loaders to a self-busting `?v=Date.now()` (as done here) so
no build file is needed.
**DEPLOY (Passport, 3 files):** `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-member-teams-loader.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html`(feed ?v=574).
After deploy: Community → Your teams → tap JLT → "Upcoming training" shows.
REDESIGN v2 (Grant: "simpler — Next Training Session section, tap → full-bleed modal of all sessions"): team detail now shows ONLY a
single **"Next training session"** summary card (`_mtSessionsSection`: date block + title + time·venue + "View all N sessions" +
chevron) → `FFPMemberTeams.openSessions(teamId)` opens a FULL-BLEED modal (`#mt-sess-modal`, fixed inset:0, #081420, back header) listing
ALL upcoming sessions via `_mtSessListHtml`→`_mtSessionRow` (calendar date block + title + time/venue + quiet status + one Going toggle).
`ackSession` re-renders the open modal list + the detail. New API: openSessions/closeSessions.
FIX (both new modals opened "behind" their parent → only visible after Back): they were appended to body with z-index 8000/7000 but
the launching overlays are z-index ~100050 (team detail `#ffp-mt-ov`) / the quest detail modal. Raised: sessions modal → **100060**,
`.q-fltmodal` → **100080**. quests-core `?v=25→26` in the dashboard so the filter z-index reaches devices (teams module self-busts).

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (af) — Solo board: header filter icon → full-bleed Country/City modal (+ Team podium fix)
Grant: "FILTER icon on header, bottom left → full-bleed modal → Country, City." DATA CONSTRAINT: `pro_teams` has NO city/country
column and pairs have no location, so a Country/City filter can only function on the SOLO (individual member) board — `quest_leaderboard`
already takes p_country/p_city. Built it there:
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js`:** dropped the old inline `q-board-panel` (location+gender) and the `q-filter-btn`; added a filter
  ICON on the quest cover header (bottom-left, `.q-cover-flt`, shows only when the quest has a leaderboard) → `openBoardFilters()`
  opens a FULL-BLEED modal (`.q-fltmodal`, fixed inset:0, #081420, close X, Country + City selects from the quest's own `_locs`,
  Clear + Show results). Apply sets boardCountry/boardCity → loadQuestBoard; icon shows an active state. New methods openBoardFilters/
  boardModalCountry/applyBoardFilters/clearBoardFilters/closeBoardFilters (Read-verified balanced; node-on-mount unreliable = truncation).
  Cache key on the <script> tag bumped `?v=24→25` in the dashboard.
- **`assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js`:** Team podium now painted (entry ae) — deploy alongside.
**DEPLOY (3 files, NO ffp-build.js):** `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html`(?v=25) + `assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js`.
NOTE: the Country/City filter is Solo-only by data reality. Team/Pair can't filter by location until teams carry a city — flag if you
want team locations added (would also let a "by city" team filter exist).

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (ae) — Team Quest OPENS ✓ — podium regression fixed (build 592)
Team Quest opens now (openTeam=openSquad fix landed). Bug: NO podium. Root cause: the search/Load-More refactor (entry 156) split
render into `paintBoard`+`listHtml`; `listHtml` COMPUTES `pod=podiumHtml(rows)` (to trim top-3 from the list) but never RENDERED it —
so the podium was dropped. (Pair renders its podium in `renderStandings`, which is why Pair kept it.) Data was fine — 8 of 9 teams
qualify at min 10. FIX: `assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js` `paintBoard` now paints `pod` between hero and the list (outside #tq-list-wrap,
so it survives search re-renders), matching Pair. FFP_BUILD→**592** (the team loader is lazy-loaded as `?v=FFP_BUILD`, so its cache key
IS the build number — this is the one place bumping FFP_BUILD actually busts the file).
**DEPLOY:** `assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-build.js`(592).
OPEN (Grant): Solo/Pair/Team should be visually IDENTICAL — Headers, Filters, Podium. Currently: Solo has member Filters
(location/gender) + Leaderboard/My-points tabs but NO podium; Pair/Team have podium + search but NO filters/tabs. Unifying needs a
reference layout + a decision on what "Filters" means for teams/pairs (no gender/location there). NOT yet done.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (ad) — Team Quest: PROPER fix (RULE 0.5) — openTeam made identical to the working openSquad (Pair)
Reverted the eager-load/alias PATCH (Grant: "proper fix ONLY"). PROOF of the real cause, from the code itself: `Quests.openSquad`
(Pair) and `Quests.openTeam` are the SAME lazy-load pattern (load loader on tap → global.open). Pair OPENS, Team doesn't → therefore
the live `ffp-quests-core.js` on the device is the OLD version whose Team card still calls `openClub` → the club loader file that was
deleted → opens nothing. It is a stale source-of-truth, not a code bug in the current file.
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js`:** `openTeam` rewritten byte-for-byte in the shape of the proven `openSquad` (var go; `if
  (window.FFPTeamQuest){go();return;}`; `_teamLoading` guard; onload→go; onerror toast). quests-core script tag stays `?v=24`.
- **Reverted:** the dashboard eager `<script>` (removed) and the team-loader `FFPClubQuest` alias (removed). No patches remain.
- `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` = dead stub → DELETE from repo.
**DEPLOY — 2 files:** `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (?v=24). (team loader already live + unchanged.)
**VERIFY THE DIAGNOSIS ON DEVICE:** on the Quests panel, does the **Pair** tab card open its quest? If Pair opens and Team doesn't,
the deployed quests-core is stale — replacing `ffp-quests-core.js` with this one fixes it (Team then behaves exactly like Pair).

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (ac) — REAL root cause: quests-core pinned at ?v=23 in the dashboard (cache) — bumped to ?v=24
The Team Quest wouldn't open no matter how many times the file was redeployed because `ffp-member-dashboard.html` loads it as
`<script src="assets/ffp-quests-core.js?v=23">` and that **?v=23 never changed** → the browser kept serving the CACHED v23 copy
(the pre-rename one that calls the deleted club loader). ffp-build.js bumps never touched that URL, so they did nothing.
- **`ffp-member-dashboard.html`:** `ffp-quests-core.js?v=23` → **`?v=24`** (forces a fresh fetch of the current file). THE fix.
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js`:** `openTeam` simplified to team-only — loads ONLY `ffp-team-quest-loader.js` (which is already live),
  no club fallback, no sticky lock.
- **Reverted my mistakes:** removed the `FFPClubQuest` alias from the team loader; `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` overwritten to a
  DEAD stub — it should be **deleted from the repo** (it does not exist in Grant's repo; I wrongly resurrected it).
**DEPLOY — 2 files:** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (?v=24) + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js`. `ffp-team-quest-loader.js` already live.
Delete `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js`. (Lesson: the cache-bust that matters is the `?v=` on the <script> tag in the HTML, NOT ffp-build.js.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (ab) — Team Quest STILL wouldn't open after deploy → both loader filenames now fully functional (build 591)
Grant deployed 590, refreshed, still nothing. Per RULE 4 (stop blaming deploy) → made it work regardless of WHICH ffp-quests-core.js
is live. Root cause: if the deployed quests-core is the pre-rename one, it calls `Quests.openClub` → loads the OLD filename
`ffp-club-quest-loader.js`, which I'd reduced to a non-functional STUB → opens nothing.
- **`assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js`:** restored to a FULL working loader (byte-mirror of ffp-team-quest-loader.js) defining BOTH
  `window.FFPTeamQuest` AND `window.FFPClubQuest`. Marked DEPRECATED COMPAT MIRROR (delete once all clients are on new quests-core).
- **`assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js`:** added `W.FFPClubQuest = W.FFPTeamQuest;` before the IIFE close (both globals from either file).
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js`:** already hardened last step (openTeam accepts either global, tries team file then club file, no lock).
Net: whichever loader filename the deployed quests-core requests (openTeam→team file, or legacy openClub→club file), it loads a full
loader → Team Quest opens. Validated: both loaders Read-verified — correct tails (`W.FFPClubQuest = W.FFPTeamQuest; })();`), bodies
mirror the node-validated original (node-on-mount = truncation artifact, RULE 3.1). FFP_BUILD→**591**.
**DEPLOY — commit these 4 (belt-and-suspenders, works no matter what's cached/stale):** `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` +
`assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-build.js`(591). RULE 0.5 debt: the club mirror
duplicates the loader — DELETE it once the new quests-core is confirmed on all clients.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (aa) — FIX: Team Quest wouldn't open from Team tab — hardened openTeam (build 590)
Grant: "can't access the Team Quest on the Quests Panel>Team tab." DIAGNOSIS (full): feed OK (member_quests_feed featured returns
Team Quest 54c2c57e), Team tab renders (hasTeam→featuredCard→onclick Quests.openTeam). **Verified `assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js`
IS live** (web_fetch → 200 application/javascript). So the file isn't missing — the break was `Quests.openTeam` in the DEPLOYED
`ffp-quests-core.js` being the pre-rename path (loads the now-STUBBED `ffp-club-quest-loader.js` → no working global → nothing opens),
plus two real bugs in openTeam: `_teamLoading` never reset on error (one failed load = every later tap dead), and it only accepted
`window.FFPTeamQuest`.
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js` `openTeam` rewritten (hardened):** accepts EITHER `FFPTeamQuest` OR legacy `FFPClubQuest`; loads
  `ffp-team-quest-loader.js` first then falls back to `ffp-club-quest-loader.js` (deploy-order safe); no sticky `_teamLoading` lock —
  each onload/onerror advances, go() short-circuits once a global exists; clear error toast only if BOTH fail.
Validated: openTeam block Read-verified balanced (node-on-mount = truncation artifact @L1172, RULE 3.1). FFP_BUILD→**590**.
**DEPLOY — the ONE file that fixes it:** commit **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js`** (+ `assets/ffp-build.js`(590) for the stamp).
`assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js` is ALREADY live (confirmed). After deploy, avatar menu should read Build 590 → Team tab → tap the
Team Quest card → overlay opens.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (z) — SOCIAL-SHARE points fixed: Share Card counts, fire-on-tap, cap 2/day (build 589)
Grant: shares weren't counting (he shares ~2×/day; Mike Bourne/Hannah Wells have 13–14 activities all shared=true but **0** share
credits). DIAGNOSIS (live data): only 9 social_shares exist platform-wide, all Grant's. THREE separate "share" actions existed and
only some paid points. Grant's calls: **only the SHARE CARD counts** (NOT the "share with connections" log toggle); **fire the credit on
TAP** (most people save the card and post to Stories manually — the OS never reports back, so waiting for navigator.share() to resolve
lost the credit); **cap = max 2 credited shares per member per day**.
- **DB migration `social_share_cap_two_per_day` (LIVE):** `log_social_share` dedup changed from "1 per (member,kind)/day" → **max 2
  per member per calendar day (any kind)**. social_shares row → existing trigger → member_action_log 'social_share' → quest points (unchanged).
- **`ffp-member-dashboard.html`:**
  - `ffpDoShareCard` (activity Share Card): now calls `ffpLogSocialShare('activity')` ONCE, on tap (right after the image is ready),
    instead of only after navigator.share() resolves / on desktop-download. Removed the two completion-gated calls.
  - `sharePassportCard`: same — fires `ffpLogSocialShare('passport')` once on tap; removed the three completion-gated calls.
  - REVERTED an interim change that credited the log-time "share with connections" toggle — per Grant, that does NOT count.
- Fitness Stats has NO separate share card; sharing from there = sharing an activity's Share Card → same fixed `ffpDoShareCard` path.
FFP_BUILD→**589**. **DEPLOY:** DB already live. Commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + `assets/ffp-build.js`(589).
CORRECTION (Grant): Mike/Hannah/Ayan/Laura DID post Activity Cards to social — the credit was lost to the iOS-suspend bug, not the
connections toggle. My earlier "connections toggle" framing was wrong.
BACKFILL (migration `backfill_social_share_9_per_member`, LIVE): per Grant "give all Passport members 9 social-share credits — 1/day
for the first 9 days." Inserted **1,116** member_action_log rows (event='social_share', points_base=5, meta.backfill=
'share_credit_2026_07_09') dated Jul 1–9 — one per day per member — for **all 124 members**, then ran `quest_eval_auto(member,
'social_share')` per member. Idempotent (meta marker). Went DIRECT to member_action_log (NOT via social_shares/log_social_share) because
`quest_record_action` always stamps action_day=TODAY and caps 3/day — a trigger path would collapse all 9 into today. Dated per-day so
each lands under the 3/day cap and inside the July window. Verified: Mike/Hannah/Ayan/Laura counted_shares=9; Grant=13 (4 real + 9);
July quest points recomputed (e.g. Mike 77, Ayan 48). NOTE: Jul 7–9 rows also sit in the Team Quest window (Jul 7–30) so every member
gets +15 points_base there too (uniform, negligible on standings). No dedicated "share my fitness stats" card exists — flag if you want one.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (y) — Pro LANDING PAGE reframed to free/open (Passport optional) — `FFP Professional app/landing.html`
Grant: "why did the landing page not update?" — because it's a separate static marketing file; my earlier changes were app/DB/backend
only. Grant's calls (AskUserQuestion): **(1) headline the dashboard as 100% FREE; Passport optional keeping $20/mo·$149/yr; (2) do
landing.html only for now.** Rewrote all old-model copy ("your FFP Passport unlocks the dashboard / one Passport login / Passport = pro
account / $20-149 = pro account") →:
- meta + og description: "the professional dashboard is free — no setup fee, no commission, keep 100%".
- hero lead: "…the dashboard is free to sign up for"; hero badge "One login/Passport=pro account" → "Free to join / no setup fee".
- strip: "Sign up free — the professional dashboard is yours" + optional-Passport (community + referral rewards) line; price-pill →
  "Dashboard free · Passport optional from $20/mo".
- pricing card: "Professional dashboard — Everything you need, free · $0/forever · Sign up free"; optional-Passport note ($20/$149 =
  community + referral rewards) added ABOVE the $99 facility note. FAQ "How do I get the dashboard?" + final CTA reworded to free.
**DEPLOY:** commit `FFP Professional app/landing.html` (static marketing page — NOT versioned by PRO_BUILD).
STILL OLD-MODEL / NOT DONE (not in my connected folders): **`professional-signup.html` on ffppassport.com** — the actual "Join"
signup form every landing CTA links to. It still needs the free/open flow + copy. Grant to add that folder or point me to it.
Also check any other ffppassport.com marketing (e.g. a professionals section on the main member site) for "$20/149 unlocks dashboard".

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (x) — Free-Pro messaging: they DON'T have a Passport → prompt to sign up, fix all copy (PRO 135)
Grant: a coach who signs up free from the website does NOT have a Passport (a free FFP booking-platform account ≠ the Passport).
Don't use language that implies they have one; add a dashboard prompt to sign up for the Passport. All Pro-app copy only (no DB/backend).
- **Overview prompt (`index.html` `renderVerifBanner`):** when `!_pro.passport_active`, shows a teal "Get your FFP Passport" card
  ("You don't have a Passport yet… sign up to track your own training, join the community, and earn referral rewards…") with a yellow
  CTA → `https://ffppassport.com/`. Renders above the listing-review banner; disappears once they have a Passport.
- **Invite toast (`ffp-professional-client-loader.js`):** "activate your own FFP Passport" → **"Sign up for the FFP Passport yourself
  to earn referral rewards."**
- **gate-locked screen (`index.html`):** reworded from "Renew your Passport to reactivate / Go to my Passport" → **"Your professional
  access is paused"** + Contact us (mailto). It now only appears if a pro is DEACTIVATED (status≠active) — access no longer depends on a
  Passport — so the old renew-Passport wording was wrong.
PRO_BUILD→**135**. **DEPLOY:** commit `index.html`(135) + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` to the FFP Professional repo. No DB/backend.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (w) — FREE / OPEN Pro sign-up (decoupled from Passport); referral still Passport-gated (PRO 134 / backend v166)
Grant: "Make the Pro sign up genuinely free and open… they can sign up via the website. They'd still need the Passport if they're
gonna collect any referral from the invite… the invite to a FFP Passport is not available unless they've actually signed up to the
Passport. But they can have their client sign up — they just won't get any referral fee."

**Two Passport gates removed (DB migration `pro_open_signup_free`, LIVE):**
- `professional_link` (onboarding) — DROPPED the `if not pro_passport_active … return 'passport_inactive'` gate; new pros are now
  inserted with `status='active'`. So any signed-in email can create a professional profile with NO active Passport.
- `professional_for_member` — `can_access` changed from `(status='active' AND pro_passport_active)` → **`(status='active')`** only.
  `passport_active` is STILL returned in the payload for referral gating. Verified all 4 existing pros keep can_access=true.
  (Pro app boot() already routes: no record→onboard, record+can_access→dashboard, else→locked. Locked now only fires if a pro is
  deactivated, not for a missing Passport. Onboard screen had no Passport copy to change.)

**Referral/invite still requires the coach's OWN active Passport:**
- Backend `GET /api/pro/invite` (`index.js`, BACKEND_VERSION→**v166**): now reads the coach's passport fields and computes
  passportActive (mirrors `pro_passport_active`). If NOT active → returns `{passport_required:true, url:'https://ffppassport.com/join'}`
  (a generic, NON-crediting join link) instead of a `?ref=CODE` link. Active → unchanged `?ref=` referral link.
- Pro app `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` `proCopyInviteLink`: stores `window._proInviteNoRef=j.passport_required` and, when set,
  the toast reads "Link copied — your client can join, but activate your own FFP Passport to earn referral rewards". Single source —
  the Clients-header button + the "client not on Passport" prompt both call it. (team-loader Add-players uses the same endpoint, so it
  also gets the non-crediting link without a Passport — correct behaviour.)

Validated: client-loader `node --check` PASS; backend invite handler Read-verified balanced, file ends `module.exports = app;` (L6743)
— node-on-mount hit the usual truncation artifact (err at L6734, RULE 3.1 → trust Read/Edit). PRO_BUILD→**134**.
**DEPLOY:** DB migration already live. Pro app — commit `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` + `index.html`(PRO_BUILD 134) to the FFP
Professional repo. Backend — commit `index.js`(v166) to the Vercel backend repo + redeploy. No Passport-app change.
INCOMPLETE/notes: "signed up to the Passport" is enforced as **active** Passport (pro_passport_active); if you want it looser (any
Passport account, even free) say so. gate-locked screen copy still says "Renew your Passport" — now only shown for a deactivated pro.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (v) — Team header hero image + description; PRO training Date/Time overflow fix (build 588 / PRO 133)
From Grant's 3 screenshots: (1) the Team Quest leaderboard header was inconsistent — flat gradient, no image, no description; (2) PRO
"New training session" Date & Time fields overflow the right margin.
- **Team header (`assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js`):** `paintBoard` now backs the header with the quest **hero image** under a dark
  scrim (`_bg`, falls back to the brand gradient) and shows the quest **description** (`descHtml`) in BOTH states (in-a-team hero + the
  "Join a team" state) — matching the Solo detail + Pair header so users understand the quest. `open()` stores `S.image`/`S.desc`.
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js` `openTeam`:** now passes `image: q.hero_image_url, desc: q.description` into `FFPTeamQuest.open`.
  Verified quest 54c2c57e has hero_image_url + description ("Get your team together and let's see who's the most active in the city!").
- **PRO Date/Time (`FFP Professional app/assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js`):** the two-up rows had `flex:1` wrappers WITHOUT `min-width:0`,
  so native `input[type=date]`/`[type=time]` (wide intrinsic width) pushed the row past the container (the City row was already fixed with
  min-width:0). Added `min-width:0` to all four Date/Time/Duration/Repeat wrappers + hardened `.ffpt-in` (min-width:0;max-width:100%;
  -webkit-appearance:none). PRO_BUILD→**133**.
Validated: team loader edits Read-verified balanced (both hero branches use _bg+descHtml); the fresh team file passed `node --check`
earlier (mount serves stale/truncated copies of pre-existing files → node-on-mount unreliable, RULE 3.1 → trust Read/Edit). FFP_BUILD→**588**.
**DEPLOY:** Passport — commit `assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `assets/ffp-build.js`(588).
PRO — commit `assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js` + `index.html`(PRO_BUILD 133). No DB/backend change.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (u) — RENAME "Club" → "Team" across the competition feature (build 587)
Grant: "What is a club quest loader??? Change that shit." It's the **Team** competition, not "club". Full rename:
- **New file `assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js`** (window **`FFPTeamQuest`**, `openTeam`, ids `ffp-tq-*`/`tq-*`, `_ffpTQ`,
  `renderTQBack`) — replaces `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js`. All user-facing "club"→"team" ("Most active team", "Search
  teams", "your team ·", "of N teams", "Carrying the team", "team rank", "team average", "Tap a team…", team-competition sign-in).
  node --check **PASS** (this file synced to the mount), ends `})();`, 319 lines.
- **Old `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js`** overwritten with a tiny DEPRECATED back-compat stub (aliases FFPClubQuest→FFPTeamQuest
  if a stale page loads it). **Grant should `git rm assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js`** after committing the new file.
- **DB migration `rename_club_rpcs_to_team` (LIVE):** created **`team_leaderboard`** + **`team_detail`** (identical avg-of-active
  bodies), **DROPPED `club_leaderboard` + `club_detail`**. Verified: team_leaderboard→9 rows, team_detail→Marina Strikers, old fns gone(0).
  (Confirmed no other DB function/view referenced the old names before dropping.)
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js`:** `openClub`→**`openTeam`** (method + the featured-card onclick `Quests.openTeam`), `FFPClubQuest`→
  `FFPTeamQuest`, `_clubLoading`→`_teamLoading`, script src → `assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js`.
NOT renamed (internal, not user-visible, left to avoid churn/risk): quests table columns `is_club_competition`/`club_metric`/
`club_min_members`; unused RPC `club_competitions_live` (no frontend refs). Flag if you want those too. FFP_BUILD→**587**.
**DEPLOY:** commit `assets/ffp-team-quest-loader.js` (NEW) + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `assets/ffp-build.js`(587); `git rm
assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` (or commit the stub). DB migration already live. No backend change.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (t) — Team Quest = INDEPENDENT avg-of-active scoring + ALL leaderboards paged/searchable (build 586)
Grant, verbatim: "Team Quests are fucken independant of solo quests… Create Team, Join A Quest, Quest Points given based on
the ACTIVE members in a team (Member need to log once before included). Example; a team might have 25 members.. but 5 have not
logged.. point average is based on the 20 members that have logged." + "All leaderboards should show ALL entries… Load More /
filter every 50… all included." + "at scale thousands of participants… easily found… super quick."

**DB migrations (LIVE):**
- `club_scoring_avg_of_active` — rewrote **`club_leaderboard`** + **`club_detail`**. Team score is now **average points over ACTIVE
  members only** (member is active once they have ≥1 `member_action_log` row inside the quest window). Points read straight from
  `member_action_log.points_base` in the quest's `[active_from,active_to]` — **independent of solo `quest_progress`**. Divisor is
  `active_members`, NOT roster. Payload adds `active_members`; `club_detail` members[] adds `active` bool. Small teams below
  `p_min_members` (default 10; leaderboard called with min via loader) are still SHOWN but gated to the bottom (qualified=false).
  Verified on **Team Quest** (id 54c2c57e, window Jul 7–30, 266 logs): Marina Strikers 12/14 active, total 675, **avg 56.3 → #1**;
  Dubai Dragons 8/11 active (3 never logged) avg over 8; JLT 1-active gated to last. club_detail #1 returns all 14 members w/ active flags.
- `quest_leaderboard_add_offset` — dropped+recreated **`quest_leaderboard`** adding **`p_offset`** (server-side paging) + stable
  tiebreak `order by points desc, member_id` so pages don't skip/dupe. Existing named-arg call sites unaffected.

**Frontend (all three leaderboards — show ALL, paged 50, name-searchable):**
- `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` — split render into `paintBoard()` + `listHtml()`; added **Search clubs** box (kept OUTSIDE the
  list container so it keeps focus) + **Show more (N)** (50 at a time); row subtitle now "X of Y active" + metric line "Average points
  per active member"; club-home header "X of Y active" + "avg / active member". Podium unchanged (hidden while searching).
- `assets/ffp-pair-quest-loader.js` — `renderStandings` now emits a **Search** box + `_lbList()` (paged 50 + Show more), updated in
  place via `FFPPairQuest.lbfilter/lbmore` (keeps focus). Podium hidden while searching. `load()` resets lbfilter/lbshown.
- `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` — `loadQuestBoard(more)` now **server-paged** via `p_offset` (PAGE=50); appends on "Show more"
  (`#q-board-more`, styled `.q-board-more`); global rank across pages; auto-refresh guarded so it won't yank a user who has paged
  past 50 or is searching back to page 1. (Solo board already had the location/gender/name search filters — the true thousands case.)

Validated: club/pair/quests-core edited blocks Read-verified balanced + files end `})();` (bash `node --check` unreliable this
session — the Linux MOUNT was serving TRUNCATED stale copies, 228/293/1165 lines vs real 320/…; RULE 3.1 → trust Read/Edit). FFP_BUILD→**586**.
**DEPLOY:** commit `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-pair-quest-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `assets/ffp-build.js`(586).
DB migrations already live (no deploy). No shell/backend change.
INCOMPLETE/notes: leaderboard "jump to my rank" pin not added (search-by-name covers "find me"); club/pair paging is client-side
(fine for hundreds) — only the individual `quest_leaderboard` is server-paged (the thousands case). July Activity Quest is Solo (headline
unticked → shows in Solo "More quests"); Team competition now rides on the standalone "Team Quest" (54c2c57e), fully independent per Grant.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (s) — FIX: Pair-quest name search broken + header now shows photo + description (build 585)
- **Search was unusable:** `FFPPairQuest.search`/`pick` called `renderCreate()` on every keystroke, repainting the whole form → the search
  `<input>` was recreated each key so it lost focus + your typed text (couldn't type a name). FIX: split out `_searchRowsHtml()` + `_renderResults()`
  which update ONLY `#pr-results` (+ `#pr-count`); search/pick now call `_renderResults()`, never repaint the form; search input has an id + autofocus.
- **Header:** `FFPPairQuest.open` now takes `image`+`desc`; `renderStandings` header uses the quest **hero photo** (dark scrim, background-size cover)
  and shows the quest **description** under the title. `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` `openSquad` passes `image:q.hero_image_url, desc:q.description`.
Validated: pair-loader front `node --check` PASS (covers all edits); ends `})();`. FFP_BUILD→**585**.
**DEPLOY:** commit `assets/ffp-pair-quest-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `assets/ffp-build.js`(585). No shell.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (r) — FFP PRO: training form standardised + Club→Team naming + Add-icon fix (PRO_BUILD 132)
CANONICAL quest model (reflect everywhere): **Solo · Pair · Team** — one mutually-exclusive format per quest (Admin `q-format`), member tabs
Solo/Pair/Team. In FFP PRO, a coach's team is a **Team** (never "Club").
`FFP Professional app/assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js`:
- **Add icon fix:** `.ffpt-ms` was missing `text-transform:none`, so inside the uppercase `.ffpt-cta` the Material-Icons ligature `add`
  became `ADD` (unresolvable → showed the word "ADD"). Added `text-transform:none;letter-spacing:normal;white-space:nowrap;` → the + renders.
- **Training form = STANDARDS, not free text:** Title → **Session type** `<select>` (`_SESS_TYPES`: Conditioning/Strength & power/Speed &
  agility/Skills & technique/Team run/Match·game/Recovery/Gym/Assessment). City free-text → **Country + City** taxonomy `<select>`s from
  `FFP_TAX.cities` (`_countryOpts`/`_cityOpts`/`_countryOfCity`, `teamSessCountry()` repopulates city on country change; defaults to UAE). Location
  stays a free venue name (venues aren't a taxonomy). `teamSaveSession` unchanged (reads `.value`).
- **"Club challenge"→"Team Challenge"**, "your club"→"your team" (Overview).
Validated: helpers `node --check` PASS; form region Read-verified (loader ~1010 lines → bash mount truncates ~L227, RULE 3.1). PRO_BUILD 131→**132**.
**DEPLOY (Pro repo):** commit `assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js` + `index.html` (PRO_BUILD 132).

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (q) — Admin Quest FORMAT = one mutually-exclusive type: Solo · Pair · Team (build 584)
Grant: the three are independent — a quest is Solo OR Pair OR Team, never two. Was two independent checkboxes (is_club_competition + is_squad_quest).
- **`ffp-admin-quests-loader.js`:** the old "Quest type" select (which was actually scoring) renamed to **"Scoring"**; NEW single **"Format"** select
  (`q-format`: solo/pair/team, defaulting from the existing flags) with a note "a quest is one of them". The two checkboxes are gone; format-specific
  options show conditionally — **Pair** → `q-squad-max` (default 2); **Team** → `q-club-metric` + `q-club-min`. `formatChange()` toggles the panels
  (replaces clubToggle/squadToggle, both removed + un-exported). Save payload now sets `is_club_competition = (format==='team')` and
  `is_squad_quest = (format==='pair')` — mutually exclusive; Solo clears both. `squad_max` default 2.
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js`:** member tabs reordered + renamed to **Solo · Pair · Team** ("Individual"→"Solo"; order Solo, Pair, Team).
- **Validated:** admin `body` string + region parse (full-file node --check truncates ~L580 RULE 3.1; ends `})();`); quests-core renderAll+setTab PASS. FFP_BUILD→**584**.
**DEPLOY (JS only, no shell — SW never caches JS):** commit `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `assets/ffp-build.js`(584).

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (p) — MIDDLE TIER = PAIR (Solo → Pair → Team); Squad renamed to Pair (build 583)
Grant locked the shape **Solo → Pair → Team**. Middle tier is now **Pair** (2), invite→accept, NO captain/approvals; a quest can still set
`squad_max>2` for an occasional small-group (the UI falls back to the fuller flow). DB tables/columns keep the `squad*` names (no rename — internal).
- **DB:** `squads.name` now NULLABLE. `squad_leaderboard`/`squad_detail`/`member_squad_for_quest` auto-name a nameless squad **"A & B"** from its
  active members' first names (migration `squad_autoname_from_members`). July quest → **"July Pair Quest"**, `squad_max=2`, reseeded 4 demo PAIRS
  (2 members each) — leaderboard verified ("Noah & Yusuf" 358 … "Omar & Sofia" 155).
- **Frontend:** file **renamed** `ffp-squad-quest-loader.js` → **`assets/ffp-pair-quest-loader.js`**, global `FFPSquadQuest`→**`FFPPairQuest`**
  (v1). Pair-first: header "Pair up" (no Join), create = pick ONE partner (no name), invite→accept, End pair / Leave. `S.pair=(max<=2)` toggles
  pair vs group labels+flow. `ffp-quests-core.js`: tab label "Squad"→**"Pair"**, `squadCard` pill/desc Pair-aware, `openSquad` loads the renamed
  file + `FFPPairQuest.open({max})`. `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js`: "Squad quest"→**"Pair quest"**, default max **2**.
- **Validated:** pair loader front-half `node --check` PASS + tail Read-verified (ends `})();`, mount truncates ~L227 RULE 3.1); quests-core region PASS.
**VERSIONING TRUTH (ends the recurring pain):** `sw.js` (line 4) **NEVER caches HTML or JS** — JS falls through to network; `_headers` = no-store.
So **JS changes ALWAYS land fresh with NO ?v bump and NO shell edit.** The `?v=` on tags + FFP_BUILD are NOT cache-busters for JS — FFP_BUILD is
purely the human "Build N" stamp (now in `assets/ffp-build.js`). **Going forward: bump `ffp-build.js` for the stamp, edit the module, done. Stop bumping ?v / the shell.**
**DEPLOY:** commit `assets/ffp-build.js`(583) + `assets/ffp-pair-quest-loader.js`(NEW) + **git rm `assets/ffp-squad-quest-loader.js`** +
`assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js`. NO ffp-member-dashboard.html / ffp-admin-dashboard.html changes needed. DB live.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (o) — BUILD VERSION DECOUPLED from the shell + SQUAD join/leave/remove lifecycle (build 582)
**(1) Version churn killed (Grant, recurring pain):** `FFP_BUILD` now lives in NEW one-line `assets/ffp-build.js` (`window.FFP_BUILD`).
`ffp-member-dashboard.html` loads it (`<script src="assets/ffp-build.js">`, NO ?v — `_headers` already serves /assets/*.js no-store) and the
shell's `const FFP_BUILD` just falls back to it. **Shipping a change now = bump `assets/ffp-build.js` ONLY; the 1.8MB dashboard is not touched.**
Lazy loaders already cache-bust off `?v=FFP_BUILD`, so a module change = edit the module + bump ffp-build.js. (Still inline in the shell:
activity-card + share-card renderers — extracting those is the remaining TOP-PRIORITY shrink.)
**(2) Squad lifecycle (was half-built — join was open):** migration `squad_join_approve_leave_remove` — dropped `squad_join`; added
`squad_request`(member asks) → `squad_approve`/`squad_decline`(captain), `squad_respond_invite`(invitee accept/decline), `squad_leave`(member),
`squad_remove`(captain), `squad_disband`(captain). `squad_create` invites now start **'invited'** (pending accept). Cap counts ACTIVE only.
`squad_leaderboard`/`squad_detail` now ACTIVE-only; `squad_detail` returns `pending` (requests+invites) + `owner_member_id`; `member_squad_for_quest` returns `status`.
`assets/ffp-squad-quest-loader.js` **v1→v2**: header states (active/owner/invited/requested/none), Join = "Request", accept/decline invite,
captain approve/decline + remove, member leave, captain disband (ffpConfirm guards). Front-half `node --check` PASS + tail Read-verified
(mount truncates ~L227, RULE 3.1). **Live smoke test PASS** (request→approve→remove + guards). FFP_BUILD→**582**.
**DEPLOY:** commit `assets/ffp-build.js` (NEW) + `assets/ffp-squad-quest-loader.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build-file tag). DB already live.
**OPEN:** "Squad" name — Grant wants a 2-4-person word (Squad feels big); awaiting his pick (Crew/Pod/Posse/Pack) → then a trivial label swap.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (n) — SQUAD QUEST (member 2-4 crews) — full feature (build 580, awaiting deploy)
Third quest scale: **Solo → Squad (2-4, member-formed) → Club (10+, coach)**. Squad tab → Squad Quest card → tap → standings (podium)
with **Create / Join on the header** → Create = name + invite connections (2-4 cap). Set up in Admin like the club competition.
**DB (LIVE):**
- `squad_quest_schema`: quests `is_squad_quest bool` + `squad_max int`(4); tables `squads`(quest_id,owner_member_id,name) + `squad_members`(squad_id,member_id,status, unique) w/ RLS on (RPC-only access).
- `squad_quest_rpcs`: `squad_create(quest,owner,name,invite[])` (cap + "one squad per quest" guard), `squad_join(squad,member)` (cap guard),
  `squad_leaderboard(quest)`, `squad_detail(quest,squad)`, `member_squad_for_quest(quest,member)`. All SECURITY DEFINER.
- `member_quests_feed_add_squads`: feed now returns a **`squads`** array (is_squad_quest quests) + excludes them from `minor`.
- Seed: **July Squad Quest** (cloned the club quest row via `json_populate_record` to satisfy NOT-NULLs; is_club_competition=false, is_squad_quest=true) + 3 demo squads (Sand Runners 672 / Dawn Patrol 317 / Early Birds 194). `squad_leaderboard` verified.
**Frontend:**
- NEW `assets/ffp-squad-quest-loader.js` (`window.FFPSquadQuest`) — standings (trophy/medal podium + list), header Create/Join, create flow
  (name + `member_search_people` connection search, 2-4 pick cap → `squad_create`), join list (`squad_join`), squad detail (crew + points bars). Ends `})();`.
- `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=22→**23**): feed `this.squads`; **third "Squad" tab** (tabs show when team OR squad exists; Team/Squad shown only if present);
  `squadCard()` (full-width, "Squad Quest" pill) + `openSquad()` (lazy-loads the new loader). Hero hidden on team/squad tabs.
- `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` (admin ?v=2→**3**): **"Squad quest" checkbox** `q-squad` + `q-squad-max` (mirrors club-comp `q-club`), `squadToggle()`, save payload adds `is_squad_quest`+`squad_max`.
Validated: squad loader + quests-core regions + admin loader `node --check` PASS. FFP_BUILD 579→**580**.
**DEPLOY (one repo):** commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html`(580) + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js`(v23) + **NEW `assets/ffp-squad-quest-loader.js`** +
`ffp-admin-dashboard.html`(admin quests v3) + `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js`. DB already live. (Don't forget the NEW file — repo sync won't have it.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (m) — PODIUM + trophy/medals + team cover banner on the club leaderboard (build 579, awaiting deploy)
Grant: "Have a podium look on leaderboards, 1st/2nd/3rd medal" (1st = TROPHY) + "Team cards to have header image". Applied to the club/Team
leaderboard (individual quest leaderboard NOT yet — Grant to decide after seeing this).
**DB (LIVE):** migration `club_detail_add_cover_url` — `club_detail` now selects + returns `cover` (pro_teams.cover_url). Seeded `cover_url`
for the 8 demo clubs = `https://picsum.photos/seed/ffp-<club>/900/360` (real photos, deterministic; graceful gradient fallback where null).
**`assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js`:**
- NEW `medalDefs()` (SVG gradient defs: gold/silver/bronze face + rim) + `medalSvg(rank,size)` — **gold TROPHY for rank 1**, silver/bronze
  MEDAL discs (embossed numeral) for 2/3. Crisp SVG, scales podium→row.
- NEW `podiumHtml(rows)` — top-3 podium (2nd|1st|3rd, pedestal heights, tappable → club). Only for non-division metric with 3+ qualified clubs.
- `renderLeaderboard`: podium inserted after the hero; the list now starts at **rank 4** when the podium shows (`listRows` filters rank<=3).
- `renderClubHome`: hero header now uses the team's **cover photo** (`d.cover`) under a dark scrim (else brand gradient) — "team card header image".
Validated: `medalDefs/medalSvg/podiumHtml` + `renderLeaderboard` `node --check` PASS; file ends `})();` (L299). NOTE: bash mount truncates this
file at ~227 lines so full-file `node --check` can't run — verified regions + tail via Read tool (RULE 3.1). FFP_BUILD 578→**579** (loader
cache-busted by FFP_BUILD via `Quests.openClub` `?v=`). DEPLOY: commit `ffp-club-quest-loader.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (579). DB already live.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (l) — FIX: Team quest club detail was EMPTY + logos missing + card sizing/framing (build 576, awaiting deploy)
Seed data WAS live (verified: 8 clubs, 98 members, club_leaderboard returns all 9 ranked). The empty club detail was a CLIENT bug.
- **ROOT CAUSE (empty Team details):** `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` `openClub` called `club_detail` with param **`p_min`**, but the RPC
  signature is `club_detail(p_quest, p_team, p_min_members)`. PostgREST arg-name mismatch → the RPC silently failed → `d={}` → empty club page
  (no members/momentum/source). FIX: `p_min` → **`p_min_members`**. (This never surfaced before because there was no seed data to tap into.)
- **Logos on leaderboard:** the leaderboard LIST rows (renderLeaderboard) had NO logo (my earlier "logos already render" claim was about the club
  DETAIL hero, not the list — wrong). Added a 40px logo (or 2-letter initials fallback) to each `cq-row`, after the rank.
- **Team card full-width:** `ffp-quests-core.js` Team tab now uses `.q-teamlist` (full-width stacked, `.q-feat` width:100% min-height:210px)
  instead of the 86%-width `.q-featrow` scroll → same size as individual quest cards.
- **"Not an extension of Individual" framing:** `featuredCard` pill "Club challenge"→**"Team Quest"**; description no longer echoes the individual
  quest text — now a team-focused line ("Team up — every member's activity lifts your whole club up the leaderboard. Win it together.").
  (Title still = quest title "July Activity Quest"; a distinct team title would need an Admin/DB `club_title` field — NOT done, flag if wanted.)
Validated: club-quest region + renderAll + featuredCard `node --check` PASS (full-file checks false-error on mount truncation — RULE 3.1).
Files: `ffp-club-quest-loader.js`, `ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=21→**22**), `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (FFP_BUILD 575→**576**). DEPLOY: commit all three.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (k) — SHARE CARD: restyled zone bar + selectable Headline (build 575, awaiting deploy)
All in `ffp-member-dashboard.html`. (1) `_ffpDrawZones` (canvas): Z4 `#f59e0b`→**`#d9531e`**, bar thicker (U*0.044→**0.058**), added a
light diagonal stripe pattern (clipped to the rounded bar) to match the activity card; `hMap.zones` W*0.12→**0.14** so the taller bar fits.
(2) NEW `_ffpHeadlineList(a)` — the member-pickable big-number metrics (Distance default → Duration/Calories/Pace/Speed/Avg HR/Max HR/Steps/
Strain, only if logged); activity NAME stays automatic (the title), NOT a headline option. (3) `_ffpMakeCardCanvas` hero now uses the chosen
headline (`_ffpShareCfg.headline`) instead of hard-coded distance/time; the chosen metric is excluded from the stat grid. (4) Options sheet:
"Main/Activity+headline (locked)" row replaced with a **Headline** horizontal-scroll picker (`#ffp-sc-headline`, no scrollbar, yellow underline
on the active one) → `window.ffpShareSetHeadline`. (5) `_ffpShareCfg.headline` init in `_ffpOpenShareSheet` + global default; `_ffpCurKey`
includes headline so the preview re-renders on change. Share-card region `node --check` PASS. FFP_BUILD 574→**575**. DEPLOY: commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html`.
**Tweak (build 577):** `_ffpDrawZones` — removed the Z1/Z2… labels UNDER the bar; now draws the **% of time INSIDE each segment** (white, shadow,
only where it fits, `w > W*0.045`); `hMap.zones` W*0.14→**0.11** (no label row). `_ffpDrawZones` `node --check` PASS. FFP_BUILD 576→**577**.
**Tweak (build 578):** `_ffpMakeCardCanvas` — slogan **"Active Lifestyle Community"** drawn under the logo (`#bcd5e8`, W*0.028), `loH` bumped so
content flows below it. `node --check` PASS. FFP_BUILD 577→**578**.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (j) — FIX: Quest tabs were BELOW the headline hero (build 574, awaiting deploy)
Grant: "Quest panel still not showing correctly." ROOT CAUSE (RULE 0): the tab bar rendered inside `#quest-sections`, which sits AFTER
`#quest-hero` in the DOM — so the big headline quest showed ABOVE the Individual/Team tabs. Grant's model = tabs are the FIRST thing you
see, quest under them. FIX: added `<div id="quest-tabs"></div>` in `ffp-member-dashboard.html` ABOVE `#quest-hero`; `ffp-quests-core.js`
`renderAll()` now paints the tab bar into `#quest-tabs` (not into `#quest-sections`). Order is now: panel header → tabs → hero (Individual) /
club card (Team) → sections. Verified feed returns featured_len=1 for Grant so tabs DO appear. `renderAll`+`setTab` region `node --check`
PASS (full-file check false-errors on a 🎉 emoji at the mount boundary — RULE 3.1). Files: `ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=20→**21**),
`ffp-member-dashboard.html` (added #quest-tabs; FFP_BUILD 573→**574**). DEPLOY: commit both.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (i) — FIX: "Find a connection" sport dropdown was blank on iOS (build 573, awaiting deploy)
Grant: the activity taxonomy wasn't showing in the Find-a-connection sport dropdown. ROOT CAUSE (RULE 0): `FFPConnFeed.openSearch`
(`assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js`) built the sport field as an `<input list="cf-sport-list">` **datalist** — which does NOT render on
iOS Safari — AND read `FFP_TAX.activities` with no fallback (empty until DB hydration). FIX (RULE 5, reuse the canonical pattern from
`ffp-connections-core.acFilter` L770): native `<select id="cf-sport">` populated from `(FFP_TAX.activities || window.ACTIVITIES_DB)`
(names via `n|name`, de-duped + sorted), "Any sport" default, `onchange=search`; both sport+level selects `FFPSelect.enhance`d (best-effort,
try/caught) → shared dark searchable picker. `node --check` PASS. Files: `ffp-connections-feed-loader.js`; `ffp-member-dashboard.html`
loader `?v=567→573` + FFP_BUILD 572→**573**. DEPLOY: commit both.
**Share card (mock only, awaiting Grant):** restyle to match new activity card (thicker patterned zone bar, Z4 `#d9531e`) + a **Headline picker**
(horizontal scroll of logged metrics — Distance/Duration/Calories/Pace/Speed/Avg HR/Max HR/Steps; activity NAME is automatic, not a choice).
Build target when approved: `_ffpDrawZones` + `_ffpMakeCardCanvas` heroKey + a headline field in `_ffpShareCfg`/Options sheet in `ffp-member-dashboard.html`.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (h) — TRIAL-ENDING (24h) email + reason-first cancel flow + email deep-link (build 572 / backend awaiting deploy)
Grant: the trial-ending reminder must (a) go 24h before, (b) once only, (c) let people cancel before the charge, and after they pick
"cancel" + give a reason, a LAST-CHANCE 14-day offer. Grounded first (RULE 0): a trial email ALREADY existed ("ends in 3 days", fired by
Stripe webhook `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` ~3 days out, no cancel CTA) — so this is a rework, not net-new. Also: `paid` is set
true during trial too and there's NO local trial column, so 24h precision needs a cron reading Stripe's trialing subs.
**Backend `index.js` (awaiting Vercel deploy):**
- `sendTrialEndingEmail` rewritten → subject "Your FFP Passport free trial ends tomorrow"; Grant's exact copy (heads-up + "become part of
  the active lifestyle community" + cancel-before-charge + feedback-via-Passport + "Your Active Lifestyle Community / FFP Team"); **NO "Keep"
  button**; single **"Cancel my trial ›"** link → `https://ffppassport.com/ffp-member-dashboard.html?action=cancel`.
- `onTrialWillEnd` (3-day webhook) → **retired to a no-op** (kept so the webhook route stays valid) — guarantees exactly ONE email.
- `/api/cron/lifecycle` → added a **trial-ending pass** (runs on the normal daily run, skipped when `?only=`): `stripe.subscriptions.list({status:'trialing'})`,
  send to anyone whose `trial_end` is within the next ~32h, **once each** via `lifecycle_sent.trial_ending`. Response now returns `trial_ending`.
  Test the look: `GET /api/cron/lifecycle?only=<email>&preview=trial` (cronAuthed).
**Passport (build 572):**
- `assets/ffp-cancel-loader.js` v1→**v2**: flow reordered to **REASON → last-chance 14-day offer → cancel** (was offer→feedback→cancel).
  `open→renderReason`; `Continue→toOffer`; offer "Keep my 14 free days" (extend) / "No thanks, cancel my membership" (doCancel). Applies to
  BOTH the Settings cancel and the email link.
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html`: added `?action=cancel` deep-link handler (polls up to 15s for an authed member, then opens the cancel flow +
  strips the param). FFP_BUILD 571→**572**. (cancel loader cache-busted by FFP_BUILD via `ffpOpenCancelMembership`.)
**Validated:** cancel-loader + backend `node --check` PASS; backend still ends `module.exports = app;`; deep-link block PASS.
**Note on Duane:** already converted (trial_end passed) — he won't receive this (it's for future trialers). Cancel him via Stripe (sub `sub_1ToPd6BnpbSTlIOBNggeaRSY`) or `/api/billing/cancel` after backend deploy.
**DEPLOY:** backend repo → commit `index.js` (Vercel). Passport repo → commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (572) + `assets/ffp-cancel-loader.js`
(+ the earlier build-571/570 files: `ffp-quests-core.js` ?v=20, `ffp-club-quest-loader.js` — all uncommitted).

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (g) — CLUB COMPETITION seed data (8 clubs, 98 members) + logos confirmed; HR-zones + Team-tab mocks (awaiting Grant)
**DB (LIVE, seed/demo — reversible):** seeded 8 clubs onto the July Activity Quest (`aa292a57-da3b-467d-97e3-55f800a4fd11`, metric avg, min 2)
via one idempotent `execute_sql` (deletes prior seed via `members.email like '%@ffpdemo.test'` + `pro_teams.description='seed-demo'`, then re-inserts):
- 8 `pro_teams` (professional_id=`ff83faf4-2da1-4f6f-a2dc-e61dcc6d5c13`, type='community', description='seed-demo', each with a `logo_url`
  = ui-avatars 2-letter crest): Desert Hawks, Al Khail Runners, Sandstorm CrossFit, Marina Strikers FC, Nomad Cyclists, Palm City Padel,
  Creek Swimmers, Dubai Dragons.
- **98** synthetic `members` (email `seed_<club>_<n>@ffpdemo.test`, REAL first/last names so club_detail shows proper names), each in
  `pro_team_members` (status active). 10–15 members/club.
- **ENRICHED (v2, same turn):** seeded `member_action_log` per member across the real event mix — log_workout(10)/attend_meetup(25)/
  host_meetup(40)/referral_monthly(50)/connect_member(8)/log_food(4) — dated across the quest window (06-29→now) so club_detail's
  **source breakdown + momentum curve populate**. `quest_progress.points` = SUM(member_action_log.points_base) per member.
  NOTE: `member_action_log` has NO scoring trigger (only `activity_logs` does), so seeding it directly is controlled/safe — that's why
  I seeded it, not activity_logs. club_detail.week/today (from activity_logs) left empty to avoid the activity-log triggers double-scoring.
- **Verified** `club_leaderboard(quest,'avg',10)` → Desert Hawks #1 (334 avg) … Dubai Dragons, real JLT team last. `club_detail(Desert Hawks)`
  → members w/ real names (Zayd 397, Omar 362…), source [Activities 1320, Referrals 1100, Meetups 1080, Community 320, Nutrition 220], 11-day momentum. Each row carries `logo`.
- **Logos already render** — `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` `avatarSquare(d)` (L230–233) draws `d.logo` in each leaderboard row (L210). NO code change needed.
- **To undo the seed:** re-run the delete block (same predicates) — no schema touched.
**BUILT — Quests Individual/Team tabs (build 570, awaiting Grant deploy):** Correct model (after several iterations w/ Grant): the tabs
are a LENS on the quest panel, not two buckets. `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` `renderAll()` rewritten — tab bar (`.q-maintabs`/`.q-mtab`,
hairline underline, NO box/pill) shows ONLY when ≥1 team quest exists. **Individual** tab = the headline hero (`#quest-hero` via renderMajor)
+ Coming soon + My quests + More quests. **Team** tab = ONLY the team quest card(s) (`this.featured` → `featuredCard` → `Quests.openClub`
→ `FFPClubQuest.open`); `#quest-hero` hidden. `setTab(t)` re-renders. Featured club cards NO LONGER appear on the individual view.
Join/create CTA lives in the club-leaderboard HEADER (not-on-a-team `hero`) in `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` — now reads
"Join a team to get involved / Join a team, or create one in the FFP Pro app — then your activity counts for the club."
Files: `ffp-quests-core.js` (CSS + renderAll + setTab), `ffp-club-quest-loader.js` (header copy), `ffp-member-dashboard.html`
(FFP_BUILD 569→**570**, quests-core `?v=19→20`). Both JS `node --check` PASS. **DEPLOY:** commit those 3 files; club-quest loader is
cache-busted by FFP_BUILD (openClub loads it `?v=FFP_BUILD`). Verify avatar-menu shows Build 570, then Quests → Team tab → tap card → header CTA.
**BUILT — Activity-card HR zones redesign (build 571, awaiting deploy):** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` HR block (~L7252–7294).
Z4 color `#f59e0b`→**`#d9531e`** (darker orange). Overall stacked bar 12px→**16px** + diagonal pattern (`_pat` repeating-linear-gradient).
Per-zone rows are now a **30px bar** (track = zone colour @14% via `_rgba`), fill = pct% with the pattern; **"Zone N · X min" white label ON the bar**
(text-shadow for contrast incl. amber Z3), **% at right**, and the **bpm range as a caption UNDER each bar** with a colour dot (`_rangeFor` now
returns "lo–hi BPM"). Minutes via `_min()`. Syntax `node --check` PASS (extracted block). Rendered/verified. FFP_BUILD 570→**571**
(covers both the Team tabs AND this HR redesign — one file, one deploy). **DEPLOY:** commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build 571) +
`assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=20) + `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js`.

## LATEST — 2026-07-09 (f) — SELF-SERVE MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION (period-end + 14-day save + feedback) (#147)
Membership = a **Stripe subscription** (Annual $149 / Monthly $20, 7-day trial). Before this there was NO self-serve cancel (only
/api/billing/checkout + resync) — cancelling was manual in Stripe. Now built:
- **DB (LIVE):** table `membership_cancellations` (member_id, reason, feedback, took_extension). RLS on (service writes).
- **Backend (index.js — awaits Vercel deploy):** `POST /api/billing/cancel {member_id,reason,feedback}` → `stripe.subscriptions.update(sub,{cancel_at_period_end:true})`
  (keeps access to period end, no future charge) + records feedback + sends a branded confirmation email (mailer + brandEmail + MAIL_FROM).
  `POST /api/billing/extend {member_id}` → the **14-day save offer** (`trial_end = now+14d`, proration none) + sets passport_expires_at.
  Inserted after /api/billing/checkout; backend still ends `module.exports = app;` (now L6697). ⚠️ Grant deploys Vercel — endpoints are dead until then.
- **Member app (Passport, build 568→569):** Settings ▸ **Membership ▸ Cancel membership** → `ffpOpenCancelMembership()` lazy-loads NEW
  `assets/ffp-cancel-loader.js` (`window.FFPCancel`, parses clean) — full-bleed flow: **14-day save offer → feedback (reasons + note) →
  cancel at period end → confirmation** with the access-until date. No box/pill/scrollbar. Decisions from Grant: keep access to period end, offer 14 more days, ask feedback.
- **DUANE MUTU (fd0bfe56, sub `sub_1ToPd6BnpbSTlIOBNggeaRSY`, cus `cus_Uo1gNA1FuzOeeJ`):** 7-day trial ended ~07-08; passport_expires_at 08-08
  suggests it CONVERTED (may already be charged). Cancel in **Stripe dashboard now** (immediate or at-period-end + refund if charged),
  OR after deploy `POST /api/billing/cancel {member_id:'fd0bfe56-…'}`. Cancellation email drafted → `Duane-cancellation-email.md`.
- **NOTE (auth caveat):** cancel/extend accept `member_id` in the body (matches the app's existing checkout/push pattern — no member-JWT
  verify helper exists). Low-severity griefing risk (cancels are reversible + period-end); harden with JWT later if wanted.
- **Deploy:** Backend repo → commit index.js (Vercel). Passport repo → commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build 569) + `assets/ffp-cancel-loader.js` (new).

## LATEST — 2026-07-08 (e) — CLUB COMPETITION ("most active club") — engine LIVE, UI in progress (#146)
Competition ranking CLUBS (= pro_teams) by their members' quest activity. Set up in ADMIN as a quest flagged club-competition.
**DB LIVE + tested:** `club_leaderboard(p_quest,p_metric,p_min_members)` (metric avg[min-10] / total / division; ranks teams by
roster's quest_progress points). `club_detail(p_quest,p_team,p_min)` → standing (rank/roster/points/avg/behind_next), every-member
points (first name), points-by-source (real catalog buckets: Activities/Meetups/Referrals/Community/Nutrition/Coaching), daily
momentum series, this-week + today squad stats (activity_logs). Quest columns added: `is_club_competition, club_metric,
club_min_members, featured`. Rank-critical numbers come from quest_progress (= leaderboard source); descriptive stats from activity_logs.
**Design APPROVED by Grant (iterated to Apple/WHOOP standard):** feature-quest card (Quest panel horizontal scroll) → standing-led
leaderboard (pin-your-position, one metric, no tabs) → club home (Today/This-week toggle, momentum chart w/ x+y axes, points-source
HORIZONTAL bars like Training Focus, top contributors, every-member VERTICAL thin bars vs an average line, no names→first names) →
rival club detail. HARD RULES honoured: NO box/pill, NO scrollbars, hairlines + big numerals.
**UI — member module BUILT + validated (node --check OK, ends `})();`):** `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` (new lazy module,
`window.FFPClubQuest.open(questId,{title,metric,minMembers})`) — full-bleed overlay, leaderboard (standing hero, pin-your-club, metric
line, tap row → openClub) + club home (Today/week toggle, momentum SVG w/ axes from `momentum`, source horizontal bars, top
contributors, every-member vertical bars vs avg line). Reads club_leaderboard + club_detail + member_my_teams (marks "you").
**MEMBER SIDE WIRED (DONE):** `member_quests_feed` now returns a **`featured`** array of live `is_club_competition` quests (+ metric/min/
active_to) and excludes them from `minor` (LIVE). `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (**?v=18→19** in dashboard L347): loads `this.featured`,
renders a horizontal **`.q-featrow`** of `.q-feat` "Club challenge" cards (scrollbar hidden) at the top of the Quests panel;
`Quests.openClub(id)` lazy-loads `ffp-club-quest-loader.js?v=FFP_BUILD` then `FFPClubQuest.open`. Member **FFP_BUILD 567→568** (L4462).
quests-core verified intact (object closes L1138 `};`; mount node --check truncates — false positive).
**Deploy (Passport repo):** commit `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` (NEW), `assets/ffp-quests-core.js`, `ffp-member-dashboard.html`
(build 568, quests-core ?v=19). To SEE it: a quest needs `is_club_competition=true` (admin UI next; or flag the July quest for a test).
**ADMIN SETUP DONE:** `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` quest form now has a **Club competition** checkbox (id `q-club`, toggles `q-club-opts`
via `AdminQuests.clubToggle`) + **Ranked by** metric (avg/total/division) + **Min members** — persisted in the direct-to-`quests` save
payload (admin writes columns directly via `.from('quests').update/insert`; NO admin_save_quest change needed). Loader busted
`ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` → **?v=2** in ffp-admin-dashboard.html (was un-versioned). So Grant creates a club competition from Admin ▸
Quests: tick "Club competition", set metric + min, set it live. It then appears as the member Quest-panel feature card automatically.
Loader verified intact (ends `})();` L578; mount node --check truncates at 550 — false positive).
**COACH SCREEN DONE — FEATURE COMPLETE end-to-end.** `FFP Professional app/assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js`: `_load` fetches
`club_competitions_live()` (new SECURITY DEFINER read → live club-comp quests) + `club_leaderboard`, stores `S.clubComp`; new
`_clubCompSection()` renders a compact "Club challenge" standing (your rank big + top-3 clubs, your club marked) at the top of the team
Overview (light theme, hairlines + numerals, no boxes/pills). Loader ends `})();` L1005 (intact). **PRO_BUILD 130→131.**
**CREATED (live now):** July Activity Quest (`aa292a57`) set `is_club_competition=true, club_metric='avg', club_min_members=2` — so the
feature is testable with real data (JLT Touch Training qualifies + ranks). Grant can change metric/min or make new club quests in Admin.
**FULL DEPLOY:** Passport repo — `assets/ffp-club-quest-loader.js` (NEW), `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=19), `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js`,
`ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build 568), `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (quests loader ?v=2). Pro repo — `assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js` +
`index.html` (Build 131). Backend already live (all DB). Facility-specific rosters deferred (clubs enter via a coach creating a Team).

## LATEST — 2026-07-08 (d) — PRO TEAM TRAINING SESSIONS + attendance → athlete Passports (#141)
**Builds:** Pro `PRO_BUILD` **129 → 130** (FFP Professional app/index.html L726). Member `FFP_BUILD` **567** (already bumped in (c)).
DB is LIVE; three frontend files await Grant's commit; push endpoint is the ONE remaining piece (below).

**DB (LIVE):** two tables `pro_team_sessions` (team_id, title, location, city, starts_at, duration_min, notes, status, **series_id**)
+ `pro_team_session_rsvps` (session_id, member_id, status going/not_going, unique per member) — both RLS-locked, accessed only via
SECURITY DEFINER RPCs. **6 RPCs:** coach `pro_team_session_save(p_pro,p_id,p)` (repeat_weeks 1–26 → weekly series, never infinite),
`pro_team_sessions_list(p_pro,p_team)` (with going/not_going/roster counts), `pro_team_session_attendance(p_pro,p_session)`
(whole roster + each one's status), `pro_team_session_delete`; member `member_team_sessions(p_me)` (my teams' upcoming + my rsvp
+ going count), `member_team_session_respond(p_me,p_session,p_status)`.

**Coach UI (FFP Professional app/assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js):** new **Training** tab in the team screen (`_tabs`/`_paint`
branch). Lists sessions (date/time/location + going·can't·no-reply chips); **New session** full-bleed page (title, location, city,
date, time, duration, **Repeat: Just this / 2 / 4 [default] / 8 / 12 weeks**); tap a session → per-athlete attendance list + delete.

**Passport athlete UI (Building FFP Passport/assets/ffp-member-teams-loader.js):** `openTeam` also fetches `member_team_sessions`;
`renderOverview` now shows an **Upcoming training** section (native section rows, NO modal box — per Grant) at the top of My-Team,
each with Going / Not going acknowledge buttons (`ackSession` → `member_team_session_respond` → re-render). Reflects the coach's tally.

**Design:** mockup approved by Grant (2026-07-08) with refinements applied: no boxed card on Passport, repeat-weekly (default a month,
not ongoing), push on new session. Recurrence + no-box + acknowledge = DONE.

**Push notification — BUILT (awaiting Vercel deploy).** Added `POST /api/team/session/notify` to the backend (index.js, right after
`notifyMember`): resolves team from `session_id`, loads the session (title/when/location) + team name, reads the `pro_team_members`
roster (excludes `removed`), and pushes each athlete via `notifyMember({title:'New training · '+title, body:team·when·location,
icon:'event', link:'/ffp-member-dashboard.html'})`. The coach save already calls it best-effort. Verified backend still ends
`module.exports = app;` (now L6649). ⚠️ Backend runs on **Vercel** — Grant must deploy the backend (commit/push) for the push to go live.

**Deploy (member + pro repos):** Pro repo — commit `assets/ffp-pro-team-loader.js` + `index.html` (Build 130). Member repo —
commit `assets/ffp-member-teams-loader.js` (busts on FFP_BUILD 567, already in the dashboard). Verify: coach adds a session (try Repeat
4 weeks) → athlete opens My-Team → sees Upcoming training → taps Going → coach's attendance shows them Going.

## LATEST — 2026-07-08 (c) — Community search by SPORT + LEVEL, and Log-Activity default photo = PROFILE PHOTO
**Build:** member `FFP_BUILD` **566 → 567** (ffp-member-dashboard.html L4462, read this turn). Connections loader cache-bust
`?v=558 → ?v=567` (L8468). DB parts are LIVE; frontend files await Grant's commit.

**(1) Community > Search by sport + filter by level (task #139):**
- **DB (LIVE):** new RPC `member_search_people(p_me, p_q, p_sport, p_level)` — name search (p_q≥2), sport substring match in
  `members.skills[].name`, exact level match in `members.skills[].level`; requires ≥1 criterion; excludes self/admins/providers;
  returns id/name/photo/city + the matched `sport`+`level` + connection status; connections sorted first. Verified (CrossFit → 8 members w/ levels).
- **Frontend (await commit):** `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` — `openSearch` now has a **sport field** (datalist from
  `FFP_TAX.activities`) + **level dropdown** (`FFP_TAX.fitnessLevels`); `doSearch()` reads all three + calls the new RPC; result rows
  show `sport · level · city`. (Old name-only `member_search_passport` left in place, unused by this path.)

**(2) Log Activity default photo = profile photo (task #142, incl. WHOOP/Garmin/other syncs):**
- **DB (LIVE):** trigger `activity_default_photo` **BEFORE INSERT on activity_logs** → if `photo_url` is blank, fills it from
  `members.photo_url`. ONE source of truth: covers manual logs, WHOOP webhook + sync, and any future source. Verified via
  self-reverting insert (blank photo → got the member's avatar).
- **Frontend (await commit):** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` — removed the "a photo is mandatory" hard block in `saveActivity` (photos
  now truly optional; the trigger supplies the default); added a note at the photo field: "No photo? Your profile photo is used as the cover."
- NOTE: this supersedes the earlier "1 photo mandatory" (#39) — photos are optional again, with the profile-photo default.
- **RETROACTIVE BACKFILL DONE (Grant, 2026-07-08):** set `activity_logs.photo_url = members.photo_url` for **133** past activities that
  had NO image (blank photo_url AND empty photos[]) where the member has a profile photo. Live immediately (card reads photo_url).
  Only activities whose member has no profile photo remain image-less. Did NOT touch activities that already had a real photo.

**(3) Meetups default discovery = member's location + listed activities (task #140):**
- `assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js` — the loader already had `myProfile()` (member city/country/sports), `scoreMeetup`
  (sport +25 / same-city +15 / same-country +5 / level-fit / recency) and `rankAndFilter`, but only applied them when the
  member ran a FIND search (`activeIntent`). Changed `installDecorator` so `MeetMove.filtered` **always** runs `rankAndFilter`
  with `activeIntent || {}` — so DEFAULT Discover is now sorted by the member's own location + listed activities (soonest-first
  as tiebreak), still showing ALL future meetups (Grant chose "prioritise, still show all", 2026-07-08). Reuses existing engine (RULE 5).
- Cache-bust: loader loads via `?v=FFP_BUILD` (567) — same build bump; commit `ffp-meet-move-loader.js` + the dashboard.
- OPEN/nuance: the meetups **location FILTER** default (historically UAE) lives deep in the fragile MeetMove core (couldn't be
  safely located this pass); the relevance sort now surfaces the member's own city regardless. If Grant wants the default filter
  itself opened to fully global 'all', that's a small follow-up once the core filter-state is pinpointed.

## LATEST — 2026-07-08 (b) — WEARABLE-SYNCED ACTIVITIES NOW EARN QUEST POINTS (DB fix, LIVE)
**Grant's ask:** WHOOP/Garmin/other-synced activities should allocate Quest points like manual logs do.
**Root cause (live code):** the `AFTER INSERT ON activity_logs` trigger `trg_quest_activity_log()` only fired the scorer
`when coalesce(NEW.source,'manual')='manual'` — so wearable inserts (`source='whoop'`/`'garmin'`/`'coach'`) were skipped.
**Fix (migration `quest_score_all_activity_sources`, APPLIED + verified live):** removed the source guard — every
`activity_logs` insert now calls `quest_track(member_id,'log_workout',…)` regardless of source.
**Why safe (no gaming/double-count):** `log_workout` catalog event has **daily_cap=1** (5 pts) enforced in `quest_record_action`
via `member_action_log(action_day)` — so multiple syncs/day, or manual+sync same day, yield ONE 5-pt credit. Trigger is
AFTER **INSERT** only + WHOOP dedups by `external_id`, so each workout scores at most once. Reuses the exact scoring call the
manual path already uses.
**Scope:** DB-only. **No frontend change, nothing for Grant to deploy** — quest_progress/leaderboards reflect it automatically.
**RETROACTIVE BACKFILL — DONE (Grant said "Backfill", 2026-07-08).** Inserted **74 `member_action_log` rows across 4 members**
(one `log_workout` per member per active UTC day, deduped against days that already had a log_workout), each with
`created_at = activity.logged_at` + `meta.backfill=true`, so the scorer's `created_at`-window filter counts only days INSIDE each
quest window (WHOOP history back to 2022 was inserted but falls outside both windows → correctly scores nothing). Then ran
`quest_recompute_all` for both live points-race quests (July Activity Quest `aa292a57`, Global Ambassador `cf0a0f6d`) — 9 members
recomputed each. Standings shifted: member `5a914aa4` → top of July quest (85.5). Backfill rows are tagged `meta.backfill=true` (reversible).

## LATEST — 2026-07-08 — TAXONOMY NAME CLEANUP (Experiences/Trips): file + nav + panel + route + booking-table refs now MATCH the frontend
**Grant's demand:** "fix the fucken thing to be what I asked" — the 2026-06-27 DB table rename (classes→experiences,
experiences→trips) left the CODE still saying "classes". Cleaned up the layers that were mismatched. **No DB migration this turn**
(tables were already experiences/trips). **Nothing deployed yet — Grant must commit the files below.**

**What changed (exact):**
- **FFP Partner app/ — file renames (real fs, verified via Glob):**
  - `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` → **`ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js`** (the one-off "Experiences" editor; body unchanged).
  - old `ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js` (a STALE DUPLICATE of the tours loader, mislabeled "TRIPS" in its header) →
    **`ffp-provider-trips-loader.js`**, then **overwritten to a deprecation stub** (couldn't `rm` on the mount; it's referenced by
    NOTHING — Grant can delete it from the repo). Trips have NO loader — they render INLINE (index.html renderExperiences/openExperienceModal).
- **FFP Partner app/index.html (ends `</html>` L6350, verified via Grep):**
  - Removed the redundant eager `<script src="ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js?v=18">` (was double-loading the tours loader).
  - Nav ids: `classes`→**`experiences`** (label Experiences), `experiences`→**`trips`** (label Trips). Panel ids `panel-classes`→`panel-experiences`,
    `panel-experiences`→`panel-trips`. Badge checks, showPanel dispatch, `LISTING_GATE_PANELS`, `openCreateClass()` all updated to match.
  - `_provLoaderSrc`: key `classes`→**`experiences`**: `ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js?v=25` (Experiences is now the ONE lazy-loaded listing loader).
  - (Internal tab-group keys `exp-*`/`listingTabState.experiences` + the inline `experiences` array [holds Trips] left as-is — internal, self-consistent.)
- **FFP Booking Platform/js/ — FIXED A LIVE BUG:** `ffp.js`, `mybookings.js`, `saved.js` were still querying the **dead `classes` table**
  (renamed away 2026-06-27) + reading `experiences` expecting TRIP fields. Swapped table names ONLY (verified by select-fields):
  `.from("experiences")`→`.from("trips")`, `.from("classes")`→`.from("experiences")`. `homepage.js`/`provider.js`/`trips.js` were ALREADY on
  the new names — LEFT UNTOUCHED. Verified `.from("classes")` = 0 matches across booking js. `item_type` string comparisons untouched (see DEFERRED).

**Net:** file names, nav/panel/route ids, the lazy-loader wiring, the DB tables, AND the booking-platform reads now all read Experiences/Trips.

**DEFERRED (planned data+code migration — NOT done, per CLAUDE.md rule on internal discriminators):**
The internal discriminator string is still `'class'` (Experiences) / `'experience'` (Trips) in: `p_kind` across 7 `provider_*` RPCs
(save/status/submit/unpublish/delete/booking_questions/duplicate), and — critically — the **STORED** `item_type` column in `bookings`,
`feature_days`, `feature_requests`, `item_reviews`, `listing_media`, `member_favorites`, plus the booking platform's item_type routing and
`FFPReload`/`openers` keys. Renaming these safely needs an ATOMIC data migration of the stored rows (touches live bookings/money) — must be a
planned pass, not a big-bang. Tracked as its own task. (This is the same reason item_type was deferred before.)

**Verify on device after Grant commits (partner + booking repos):** Partner → Engagement → **Experiences** tab opens + lists + create/save/publish
works; **Trips** tab opens + lists. Booking site (findfitpeople.com) shows experiences + trips again (was querying a dead table).

## ★ CURRENT STATE — 2026-07-06 (as of this update). BUILD NUMBERS IN THE FILES (ready; device stamp = truth for deployed):
- **Member FFP_BUILD = '556'** (ffp-member-dashboard.html L4464). **Pro PRO_BUILD = '123'** (FFP Professional app/index.html L726).
  Backend index.js unchanged this stretch. Grant deploys each repo manually; commit BOTH the loader AND index.html/dashboard together (the `?v=`
  cache-bust lives in the HTML — committing one file without the other = stale/cached loader = "no change").
- **Two Pro apps, separate repos:** FFP Professional app (coach, ffpprofessional.com, LIGHT theme) and Building FFP Passport (member, ffppassport.com,
  DARK #0a1825). Supabase project kxzyuofecmtymablnmak. Coach lazy loaders load `assets/x.js?v=PRO_BUILD`; member panels `?v=FFP_BUILD`.
- **TEAM / BENCHMARK / SKILL feature (built this stretch, PRO 102→123 + member 539→556):**
  - **Model (Grant, locked):** a BENCHMARK is a shared MEASURED test (from the global `benchmark_templates` catalog: 3km run=Endurance, Illinois
    agility=Agility, etc. — 21 seeds, single-word category) that a TEAM CHOOSES to add. A SKILL is a SEPARATE concept — coach-assessed, 5 LOCKED
    levels (Developing/Competent/Proficient/Advanced/Elite) with editable descriptions + a target level. Benchmarks ≠ skills; skills are NOT on the
    Benchmarks list.
  - **Coach (ffp-pro-team-loader.js):** Nav tab "Teams" → LANDING cards → team OVERVIEW (team-avg graph + Doing-the-work + Skills level-columns w/
    per-level COUNTS + Training Focus by ACTIVITY) + ATHLETES tab (strip w/ "+" add first, tap → athlete detail: benchmark dot-graph [empty graph
    until first result], week tiles, SKILLS as tap-to-confirm level chips [teamSkillSet], recent-activity cards w/ photo → tap = full read-only
    Activity card modal via pro_activity_detail, nutrition [last-7 fixed window, day+date chips, patterned macro bar]). Team SETTINGS = 4 tabs
    (Athletes · Benchmarks · Skills · Details); Benchmarks/Skills each list + "+ Add" (own tab) and each row TAPS TO EDIT (pro_benchmark_get pre-fills;
    p_id update) + delete. Athlete logs measured results themselves (coach "+log" removed). Cover/logo upload uses UNIQUE keys (…-Date.now()) so
    updates aren't CDN-cached.
  - **Passport (ffp-member-teams-loader.js):** Community panel "Your teams" horizontal cards (270px, HEADER photo cover + logo crest) + "Find a team"
    (member_find_teams/request_join). Tap a team → read-only team OVERVIEW (member_team_overview). Empty state = dotted "+" card → find a team.
  - **Passport Fitness Stats › "Benchmarks" tab** (was "Records", ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js): searchable DROPDOWN (solid bg, ALPHABETICAL, single-word
    CATEGORY under each name) of built-in metrics + the athlete's team measured benchmarks (skills excluded); pick one → built-in shows PR card +
    leaderboard, team benchmark shows current/target + "Log result" → member_record_benchmark (athlete logs own result → coach's team view reads it).
  - **KEY DB FIXES:** (1) `pro_benchmarks.direction` was NOT NULL → skills (direction=null) silently rolled back on insert (Supabase .rpc returns the
    error, doesn't throw, so the app showed false "added") → made NULLABLE; skills now save. (2) member_my_teams/pro_teams_list return cover_url;
    pro_teams_list returns description; member_my_benchmarks returns category (catalog name-match). Frontends HARDENED to check r.error on saves.
  - **New RPCs (all SECURITY DEFINER):** member_team_overview / member_team_players / member_athlete_detail (member-authorised), member_my_benchmarks,
    member_record_benchmark, pro_activity_detail, pro_benchmark_get, pro_benchmark_delete; + earlier pro_team_* / pro_benchmark_upsert(+p_id)/record.
  - **Awaiting Grant deploy:** Pro Build 123 (ffp-pro-team-loader.js + index.html) · Passport Build 556 (ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js +
    ffp-member-teams-loader.js + ffp-connections-feed-loader.js + ffp-member-dashboard.html). All DB migrations already LIVE.

- **Pro access is BUNDLED with a paid FFP Passport membership** — there is NO separate Pro payment. Buy Passport → the
  SAME login opens the Professional dashboard. (Grant: "purchase FFP Passport → automatic access to FFP Professional.")
- **PRICING: $20/month or $149/year** (one Passport membership, unlocks Pro). Keep 100% of bookings (no commission).
  Facilities/Business suite (Partner) = flat $99/month, first 2 months free.
- **SIGNUP URL (pro funnel):** `https://www.ffppassport.com/professional-signup.html` (this is the CTA on
  findfitpeople.com/for-professionals — "Join as a professional"). Paid Passport signup that unlocks Pro.
- **Landing content source:** `findfitpeople.com/for-professionals` (dark hero #0e2f3d "Coach more · chase admin less" →
  "Get discovered and booked…"; sections: profile / schedule / check-in→reviews / FFP Coach; How it works 4 steps;
  pricing; 5-Q FAQ). Images in Supabase `site-images`: ffp-pro-6-screens.png, ffp-pro-profile.png, ffp-pro-schedule.png,
  ffp-pro-checkin.png, pro-ffp-coach.png.
- ✅ DONE (2026-07-01): ffpprofessional.com LANDING built. Structure: `landing.html` (NEW, full for-professionals marketing
  page — hero, features w/ Supabase screenshots, How-it-works, $20/$149 pricing, FAQ) served at ROOT; the app (gate+dashboard,
  `index.html`) served at `/app`; via pro-repo `_redirects` (`/ → /landing.html 200!`, `/app → /index.html 200`). CTAs →
  https://www.ffppassport.com/professional-signup.html; "Sign in" → /app. Passport `login.html` pro redirect updated →
  https://ffpprofessional.com/app; main-repo `_redirects` old pro paths → /app. (Signup page still lives on ffppassport.com.)

## FFP PRODUCTS — FOUR distinct apps under "Find Fit People" (Grant, 2026-07-01 — commit to memory)
Each is its OWN app with its own focus — NOT modes of one app. Do not lump them together.
1. **Find Fit People** — the MARKETPLACE: discovery & booking. (Booking site, findfitpeople.com.)
2. **FFP Professional** — CLIENT MANAGEMENT for fitness & sports coaches. (Its own app — `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`.)
   DOMAIN: **www.ffpprofessional.com** (its own dedicated domain — per Grant 2026-07-01; NOT referenced anywhere in this
   repo, so its deployment state (live? empty? already serving the pro app?) is UNCONFIRMED — verify with Grant, don't assume).
   This dedicated domain = its own ORIGIN = the correct home that fixes #41 (own service worker + push identity).
3. **FFP Passport** — the PREMIUM PUBLIC platform for connecting, engaging & tracking. (Member app — `ffp-member-dashboard.html`.)
4. **FFP Partner Dashboard** — FACILITY management & service promotion. (`ffp-provider-dashboard.html`.)
> ⚠️ CURRENT-DEPLOYMENT CAVEAT (verified in this repo 2026-07-01): all of the above dashboards + `index.html`/`login.html`
> are served from ONE Netlify site / ONE origin (per `_redirects`, apex ffppassport.com). That shared origin is the ROOT
> CAUSE of the reopened #41 push-icon bug — separate PRODUCTS must become separate ORIGINS. CONFIRMED 2026-07-01:
> FFP Professional is NOT its own deployment today — `login.html` L517 routes a signed-in pro to the same-origin relative
> path `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (no separate pro domain referenced anywhere). So splitting it to its own origin
> is net-new infra. Domain choice (pro.ffppassport.com vs a standalone domain) is Grant's branding/infra call.

## STAGE B — PARTNER → partner.findfitpeople.com (IN PROGRESS 2026-07-01)
Mirror of the Professional split. Standalone Partner app assembled in `_partner-app/` (Building FFP Passport): index.html
(=ffp-provider-dashboard.html) + all 19 `ffp-provider-*` loaders + sw.js + 12 asset libs (ffp-api-integration, constants,
taxonomy, location-picker, time, currency, select, image-upload, gallery, analytics, feedback-widget, ffp-agent) + 3 icons.
CORRECTION (2026-07-02): ffp-provider-auth.js is ONLY a role GUARD, not a sign-in — it read the session and, on none, did
`location.href='/login'` expecting the Passport login. On the standalone partner origin there was no /login → the "Page not
found" 404 Grant hit. Partner now has its OWN self-contained sign-in `login.html` (built 2026-07-02, see LATEST). Marketing lives at findfitpeople.com/partner.
DONE (main ffp-passport repo, deploy AT cutover once domain live): `login.html` provider portal → https://partner.findfitpeople.com/ ;
`_redirects` /provider + /ffp-provider-dashboard.html → https://partner.findfitpeople.com/ (301).
GRANT TO DO: new repo `ffp-partner` from _partner-app → Netlify site → **partner.findfitpeople.com** (subdomain = GoDaddy
**CNAME `partner` → <site>.netlify.app**, NOT an A record) → set Vercel `PROVIDER_DASH_URL=https://partner.findfitpeople.com` +
redeploy → commit the main-repo login.html + _redirects. FOLLOW-UP: add a partner manifest (ffp-partner.webmanifest) for PWA
identity + confirm the provider "Demo mode" sign-in (ffp-provider-dashboard L2204: any email + any 6-digit code) is OFF in prod.

## WORLD-CLASS SETUP — target architecture + roadmap (2026-07-01)
TARGET: each product on its OWN origin, sharing ONE backend API + ONE Supabase DB + ONE FFP account (members table),
per-domain sign-in, each origin with its own service worker / PWA identity / push. (This also permanently fixes #41.)
- Domains: `ffppassport.com` = Passport (member) · `ffpprofessional.com` = Professional · `findfitpeople.com` = Marketplace
  **+ Partner dashboard + Admin** served here. One FFP account; sign in on each product's own domain.
WHY IT'S NOT A BIG BACKEND JOB (verified): CORS is `*`; OAuth returns to the BACKEND (provider redirect URIs unchanged);
front-end redirect targets are ENV VARS (SITE_URL, PRO_DASH_URL, PROVIDER_DASH_URL, MEMBER_APP_URL); auth is per-origin
localStorage (per-domain sign-in already the model). So the work is HOSTING + FRONT-END ROUTING + a few env vars.
WORKSTREAMS:
  1. Hosting: one Netlify site per domain (from THIS repo for now; split repos later if desired) → each gets its own SW.
  2. Per-origin PWA: manifest + icons + name per product so each installs as its own app (this is the real #41 fix).
  3. Routing/links: login role-routing sends each role to its product domain; cross-product links become absolute
     cross-domain URLs; add old-path→new-domain redirects on ffppassport.com for migration.
  4. Backend env vars (Vercel, no code): PRO_DASH_URL=https://ffpprofessional.com; PROVIDER_DASH_URL + SITE_URL for
     partner/admin under findfitpeople.com; MEMBER_APP_URL stays.
  5. Repoint email/push deep-links to the correct product domain.
  6. (Optional, later) cross-domain SSO so one login carries across products — NOT required; per-domain sign-in is fine.
SEQUENCE (staged, verify each live before next): A) Professional → ffpprofessional.com (also fixes #41 for pros, proves
the pattern). B) Partner + Admin → findfitpeople.com. C) confirm Passport clean on ffppassport.com.
OPEN DECISIONS: (a) confirm Partner+Admin live under findfitpeople.com; (b) shared common libs — per-repo copies (now)
vs a single shared-assets origin (Stage 2, avoids drift — the truly world-class bit).
STAGE A STATUS (2026-07-01): Pro app repo `grant2223/ffp-professional` LIVE on Netlify (ffpprofessional.netlify.app);
domain ffpprofessional.com added + GoDaddy DNS set (A @ →75.2.60.5, CNAME www→ffpprofessional.netlify.app) — propagating.
Main-repo CUTOVER changes DONE (commit when ffpprofessional.com is green): `login.html` routes pros →
https://ffpprofessional.com/ ; `_redirects` sends /ffp-professional-dashboard.html + /professional → https://ffpprofessional.com/.
AT CUTOVER also set Vercel env `PRO_DASH_URL=https://ffpprofessional.com` + redeploy backend. Then verify pro sign-in on the
new domain + notification shows FFP Professional.
PRO LOGIN — uses the STANDARD login.html components (2026-07-01): code entry is the SINGLE `.code-digit` input
(one box, placeholder "••••••", autocomplete one-time-code) — NOT 6 boxes; email step = FFP logo + "Professional Sign In"
badge + "Sign In" + `.field/.label/.input` + solid button "Get My Code"; code step badge + "Enter your code" + single box +
"Sign In". `proVerifyCode` reads `#si-code` (single input). All copied from login.html, branded teal (#0a3e44), scoped to .gate.
RULE for any FFP login element: COPY it from login.html — do not reinvent (6-box code entry was a reinvention; killed).
PRO LOGIN RESTYLE (2026-07-01): pro gate restyled to MATCH the standard login (login.html) design, branded Professional.
Edited in the FFP Professional app repo: `index.html` (added Montserrat; `.gate` CSS → light #edf0f2 bg, no card, FFP
logo top, "Professional Sign In" person-icon badge, 26/900 "Sign In", clean white rounded fields, solid TEAL #0a3e44 button
— all scoped to `.gate` so the dashboard theme is untouched) + `assets/ffp-pwa.js` (install prompt "FFP Passport"→"FFP
Professional", ffppassport.com→ffpprofessional.com, button teal). NO "Become A Member" link on pro (a pro isn't a member;
the gate onboards new pros after sign-in). NOTE: FFP logo loads cross-origin from ffppassport.com/assets/ffp-logo.png for
now (bash couldn't write the binary to the new mount) — self-host in the pro repo later. Commit index.html + ffp-pwa.js.
CROSS-ORIGIN SIGN-IN FIX (2026-07-01): first cutover attempt authenticated the pro ON ffppassport.com then redirected to
ffpprofessional.com → stranded at the pro sign-in (session is per-origin localStorage). FIX: `login.html goToSignIn()` now,
when portal='professional', redirects to https://ffpprofessional.com/ BEFORE auth — the pro signs in ON the pro origin so the
session lands there. (Re-commit login.html.) Confirms the world-class model: each product signs in on its own domain.
--- earlier ---
Standalone Pro app assembled in `_ffpprofessional-app/` (22 files, self-contained:
index.html [=ffp-professional-dashboard.html], own manifest scoped "/", own sw.js, 4 pro loaders, only the shared libs it
uses, own icons; has its OWN in-page sign-in `.gate` so no login.html dependency). REMAINING for Stage A: Grant creates a
new GitHub repo from that folder → Netlify site → ffpprofessional.com + DNS → set Vercel `PRO_DASH_URL=https://ffpprofessional.com`;
then main-repo side: login.html routes pros to the new domain + old `/ffp-professional-dashboard.html`→new-domain redirect;
repoint any ffppassport.com cross-links inside the pro app.

## AGENTS — THREE distinct AIs, DIFFERENT jobs (verified 2026-07-01 by reading the files — do NOT merge them)
1. **Business agent** (branded "FFP Coach" on the pro side) — helps a PARTNER/PROFESSIONAL **run their business**
   (finish setup, connect Stripe, add services/packages, navigate, confirmed write-actions). Frontend
   `assets/ffp-agent.js` (loaded ONLY on `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`; `?v=3`).
   Backend `agentSystem(role,ctx)` + POST `/api/agent/chat` + `/api/agent/execute` (index.js L3989/4035/4126);
   model `AGENT_MODEL` (Sonnet). Floating launcher + slide-in chat.
2. **Coach Grant (member)** — helps a MEMBER **improve their active lifestyle** (habits, streaks, consistency,
   meet-ups, motivation). SPEC = `FFP-COACH-MEMORY-SPEC.md` (READ IT before coach work). Memory: table
   `member_coach_profile` (summary + facts + support_ops + `coach_line`) built by `computeCoachProfile` (index.js
   L5030; nightly cron `/api/cron/coach-profiles`). Frontend `assets/ffp-coach-loader.js` — Passport card
   `#ffp-coach-mount` + full-screen chat, on `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (`?v=513`). Backend POST `/api/coach/profile`
   + `/api/coach/chat` + `/api/coach/history` (index.js ~L5164+); model `WORKOUT_MODEL` (Haiku); chat history in
   `member_coach_messages`. ⚠️ OPEN DECISION: the spec (§9) intended the member coach to RIDE the in-app agent +
   injected memory; it was instead built as its own `/api/coach/*` stack. Grant's position: three DISTINCT agents.
   Do NOT "consolidate" without Grant's explicit call.
3. **Booking agent** — helps people **discover + book** on the booking site (findfitpeople.com). Lives on the booking
   site, NOT in this repo/workspace. [file/endpoint details TBD — read the booking site before claiming anything.]

## PLATFORM LAYOUT — PASSPORT / ACTIVITIES (commit to memory — read before touching activities)
**Activities are LOGGED** via: `log_activity` RPC (manual log), venue check-ins, and WHOOP sync → all rows in the
`activity_logs` table (cols incl. activity, venue, city, country, checkin_lat/lng, duration_min/sec, calories,
distance_km, avg_heart_rate, notes, logged_at, source, metrics jsonb, photos, shared, region, area).
**Activities are DISPLAYED in TWO independent places, both GET `/api/members/:id/activity-logs`:**
1. **Passport home** (`ffp-member-dashboard.html`): `loadJourneyLogs()` (init + on passport-panel open) fetches →
   fills global `LOGS[]` → calls `renderAll()`. `renderAll()` order: passportPicker, stats, trend, trendCrew,
   **renderActivities (#activities-list = "Top Activities")**, **renderVenues (#venues-list = "Top Places")**,
   connections, JourneyMap. (`renderRecent` = recent feed, called separately.) `renderAll` first line builds
   `getFilteredLogs()`/`getLocationLogs()` (location+passport-lens filters of LOGS). **If any pre-activities
   step throws, the lists blank** → that's why `renderAll` now wraps each call in try/catch (Build 481).
2. **My Stats panel** (`assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js`): its own `activityCache` (same endpoint) →
   `renderRecentList()` (#fs-recent, browse-by-month) + the records/leaderboard (`renderMyPrCard`). Separate tab
   from the activity list.
DEBUG RULE: bash/the shell mount serves TRUNCATED copies of big files — `node --check`/`tail`/`wc` LIE on
ffp-member-dashboard.html (1.8MB) + backend index.js. VALIDATE only via the Read tool (the real deployed file).

## ‼️ 2026-07-01 · AUTH BUG — signups get a dead "Confirm Email" LINK instead of a 6-digit CODE (Supabase template misconfig)
Report: Rio Nunga (onezero_19@yahoo.com) got a "Confirm Email" email with a dead link; "not supposed to be a thing."
VERIFIED:
- Member login uses **Supabase Auth OTP**: `login.html` `requestCode` (L661) → `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({shouldCreateUser:true})`
  (L681; resend L647) → advances to **`screen-signin-code`** (L684) which waits for the user to TYPE A 6-DIGIT CODE.
- So the app EXPECTS Supabase to email a 6-digit **code** (`{{ .Token }}`). Rio instead got a confirmation **LINK** → he had
  no code to enter, and the link targets a Supabase Site-URL redirect that isn't wired up → dead end.
- DATA: Rio exists ONLY as an unconfirmed `auth.users` row (email_confirmed_at null, created 07-01 12:19), NO members/providers
  row. Scope: 13 auth users, 1 unconfirmed, **3 orphans with no member row** (started login, never completed). The other ~10 work.
- ROOT CAUSE: **sign-in used native Supabase OTP with `shouldCreateUser:true`** (login.html L495 `FFP_NATIVE_AUTH=true`), so a
  non-member hitting Sign In got a Supabase auth.users row + Supabase's email — which is in link/confirm mode (dead redirect),
  not the 6-digit code the UI waits for.
- ✅ CORRECT FIX APPLIED (2026-07-01, backend v147 + login.html — native OTP KEPT, not disabled):
  - NEW `POST /api/auth/prepare-signin {email}` (index.js, before /api/auth/exchange): unknown email → `{exists:false}`;
    real member → ensures a Supabase auth user PRE-CONFIRMED (`admin.createUser email_confirm:true` → NO Supabase email).
  - `login.html` sign-in now calls prepare-signin first, then `signInWithOtp({shouldCreateUser:FALSE})` (requestCode + resend).
    Unknown email → routed to "Become a member". So sign-in NEVER mints an orphan auth user and Supabase never sends its
    dead confirm-link. (Earlier stop-gap of flipping FFP_NATIVE_AUTH=false was a PATCH — reverted; flag stays true.)
  - Verified: `node --check` of the edited login.html functions = OK; backend new endpoint parses (whole-file check false-errors
    only at the mount-truncation line, well past the edit). AWAITING GRANT DEPLOY: commit index.js (v147) + login.html.
- ✅ RIO CLEANED: deleted his orphan unconfirmed auth.users row (id b3800ee1…, onezero_19@yahoo.com). Once login.html deploys,
  Rio signs up/in normally → FFP 6-digit code → in.
- STILL TO DO (hygiene, Grant): remove the deployed leftover test page `ffp-auth-exchange-test.html` (also does
  signInWithOtp shouldCreateUser:true). And IF native OTP is ever re-enabled: fix the Supabase Magic Link template to send
  `{{ .Token }}` + set Site URL, AND change sign-in to shouldCreateUser:FALSE. (2 other confirmed-but-no-member auth rows left as-is — not broken.)
- NOTE: there are TWO auth paths — native Supabase OTP (member portal, `ffpUseNative`) vs legacy backend `FFPApi.requestCode`
  (access_code). Messy; documented here so it's not rediscovered.

## ‼️ REOPENED 2026-07-01 · #41 NOT FIXED — Passport push STILL shows "FFP Pro" icon (4th report). ROOT CAUSE was mis-diagnosed.
The v144 "app-scoping" work (tag push_subscriptions/device_push_tokens by app, filter sendPushToMember to app='member')
was the WRONG LAYER and did not fix it. VERIFIED this session:
- Member app + Pro app are the **SAME ORIGIN** (ffppassport.com). Member: `<title>FFP Passport</title>`, `/manifest.webmanifest`.
  Pro (`ffp-professional-dashboard.html` L40-48): `/ffp-pro.webmanifest`, name **"FFP Pro"**, icons `ffp-pro-32/180.png`.
- **ONE service worker for the origin** — `sw.js` (root). Its push handler shows `icon: data.icon || '/assets/icons/ffp-icon-192.png'`
  (the FFP MEMBER icon) — there is NO pro icon in sw.js.
- Grant's push rows: **2 web subscriptions, both `app='member'`, no native FCM tokens** (device_push_tokens empty).
- MECHANISM: a web-push notification is rendered by the single shared SW, then ATTRIBUTED BY THE OS to whichever PWA is
  installed on the device. Grant has the **"FFP Pro"** PWA installed → every push (incl. member ones like Mike Bourne) is
  branded FFP Pro. The `app` tag only controls WHICH SUBSCRIPTION receives a push — it CANNOT change the installed-app
  attribution. So no payload/tag change can fix a device that has the Pro PWA installed.
- REAL FIX (needs Grant infra decision, NOT a code one-liner): **(1) serve Pro from its own origin** e.g. `pro.ffppassport.com`
  (own SW + own subscription + own notification identity) — correct fix; or **(2) distinct SW scope per app** (member SW at `/`,
  pro under `/pro/`) — requires restructuring flat root files. Do NOT attempt another payload/tag "fix".
- STATUS: task #41 reopened. Grant's call: FFP Professional gets its OWN DOMAIN **www.ffpprofessional.com** (own origin = fix).
- MIGRATION MECHANICS — VERIFIED in index.js (2026-07-01), the backend was built for multi-domain, so this is SMALL:
  - **CORS = wildcard** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'` (L498/505) — new origins work with NO backend change.
  - **OAuth returns to the BACKEND** (stable Vercel URL), not front-end: WHOOP `/api/wearables/whoop/callback` (L3393),
    Stripe `/api/facility|pro/connect/return` (L1912/2052), Google `/api/calendar/google/callback`. So provider-registered
    redirect URIs DO NOT change when front-end domains move.
  - **Front-end redirect targets are ENV VARS w/ defaults:** `SITE_URL` (L1540, member/login/verify), `PROVIDER_DASH_URL`
    (L1885, partner Stripe return), `PRO_DASH_URL` (L2043, PRO Stripe return), `MEMBER_APP_URL`/`WEARABLE_MEMBER_APP` (L3397, WHOOP).
    → Moving Pro = set Vercel env `PRO_DASH_URL=https://ffpprofessional.com`; moving Partner = set `PROVIDER_DASH_URL` to its
    findfitpeople.com URL. NO code change for those redirects.
  - **Auth is localStorage (`ffp_refresh` + JWT) = PER-ORIGIN** → each domain has its own sign-in (matches Grant's intent:
    "go to findfitpeople.com to sign in"). Cross-domain single-sign-on would be a separate, bigger piece — not needed now.
  - So Stage-A code work = front-end only: login routes pro → the new domain, pro manifest scope, old-path→new redirect,
    repoint pro cross-links. Infra = Netlify site + DNS + set `PRO_DASH_URL`.

## LATEST — 2026-07-08 · PARTNER "DRAFT → PUBLISH" + GATING — DB ENGINE BUILT & VERIFIED (live; frontend next)
Requirement (Grant): partners create an account + build/draft listings freely; **gated only at Publish** (going live on
findfitpeople.com). Same flow for ALL partner listing types. Design signed off via the flow diagram + the real
Business/Engagement grouping (read from `FFP Partner app/index.html` NAV, NOT guessed).
- **Model:** `draft → in_review → PUBLISHED`, where PUBLISHED = each table's EXISTING live value (`live` for
  experiences/trips/events, `active` for session_templates/provider_services/provider_plans). Audit showed the
  booking platform already filters to `status='live'`/`'active'` → **no booking-platform changes, drafts can't leak.**
- **Gate (Grant):** FFP verification — **Business** (`providers.business_access`, the existing $99/mo) or **Engagement**
  (`engagement_access`, NEW) matching the listing's section; **paid listing → Stripe connected** (`payments_status`).
  **Verified facility → auto-publish; unverified → in_review** (submitted for review).
- **DB (all live, additive, no deploy):** added `providers.engagement_access(+_at/_by/_requested_at)`; added
  `submitted_at/published_at/review_note` to the 6 listing tables; **widened the status CHECK constraints**
  (events/experiences/trips/session_templates) to allow `draft,in_review,changes_requested,rejected`.
- **RPCs (SECURITY DEFINER):** `provider_listing_submit(p_provider,p_kind,p_id)` runs the gate (kind→table map:
  class→experiences, event→events, experience→trips, session→session_templates, service→provider_services,
  plan→provider_plans; verified→published else in_review; paid+no-Stripe→blocked). `provider_listing_unpublish`.
  `admin_listing_decide(approve/changes/reject)`. `admin_provider_grant_access(business|engagement)` → auto-publishes
  that provider's queued `in_review` listings. **VERIFIED** end-to-end (self-reverting test: draft→submit=in_review→
  grant→live). Ownership via existing `assert_provider_owner`; admin via `admin_users`.
- **INCOMPLETE (frontend — repos now mounted: `FFP Partner app`, `FFP Booking Platform`):** partner listing editors
  need Save-draft + Publish buttons + gate messaging (get verified / connect Stripe) + Drafts-vs-Live views; new
  listings should default to `draft` (events/trips currently insert `pending` via `provider_save_listing` — change to
  `draft`). Admin dashboard needs a **listings-to-review queue** wired to `admin_listing_decide`/`admin_provider_grant_access`.
  Booking platform = NO change needed.
- REFINED (found existing flow): the platform ALREADY does draft→`pending`→admin-approve→`live` (providers can't self-publish
  via `provider_set_listing_status`). So the RPCs were re-aligned to use the EXISTING `pending` review state (not a new
  `in_review`) → reuses the current admin approval screens. Deltas are small: don't auto-submit on save (stay draft), add a
  Publish button (gated), verified→auto-publish, +Engagement approval, +Stripe gate.
- FIRST PARTNER LOADER WIRED — **Experiences** (`FFP Partner app/ffp-provider-classes-loader.js`, kind `class`, ?v=23→24):
  new listings stay `draft` (removed the auto-submit-to-pending in saveClass); save button "Submit for review"→"Save draft";
  card gets a **Publish** button (draft/changes_requested → `provider_listing_submit`) and **Unpublish** (live → draft via
  `provider_listing_unpublish`); shows Pending / Changes-requested (review_note) states. Parse-verified (ends `})();`).
  REMAINING loaders to mirror: events, trips (kind experience), sessions (session_templates), services, plans/packages;
  + admin: add "grant Engagement access" to the review screen (approval of `pending` already exists).

## LATEST — 2026-07-07 · LANDING moved into index.html (the served file) + social-share (OG) tags added
Grant: "ffp-passport-landing.html code needs to be moved into index.html — that's the actual file we use." Done: `cp ffp-passport-landing.html → index.html` (they're now IDENTICAL; ffp-passport-landing.html is redundant, safe to delete). index.html therefore carries the PWA icon head + the new social-share block.
SOCIAL SHARE (Open Graph + Twitter, per Grant): `og:title`/`twitter:title` = "FFP Passport"; `og:description`/`twitter:description` = "The Active Lifestyle Community"; `twitter:card=summary_large_image`; `og:url=https://ffppassport.com/`. **`og:image` = `site-images/passport-on-stepper.png`** (BEST GUESS for the treadmill/gym lifestyle shot Grant referenced — NOT confirmed; needs Grant to verify the exact filename; one-line swap if wrong). Previously there were NO og/twitter tags anywhere on the Passport → link previews had no image.
Deploy: commit index.html (+ manifest + root apple-touch-icon PNGs from the prior entry). NOTE: og:image should ideally be ~1200×630; the referenced image is larger/4:3 — platforms crop, fine for now.

## LATEST — 2026-07-07 · PWA ICON — "Add to Home Screen" showed a black screenshot ("F"), not the FFP emblem (frontend; awaiting Grant's commit)
Symptom (Grant, iOS): adding FFP Passport to the home screen gave a BLACK icon with an "F" — that's iOS's SCREENSHOT FALLBACK of the black login page, which happens when it can't USE an apple-touch-icon at add time. The icon FILE was fine (assets/icons/ffp-apple-touch-180.png = the emblem, opaque 180×180, served live) and the `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` was present on login.html + the dashboard — but pointed at `/assets/icons/…?v=3`. Two iOS gotchas fixed:
1. **Root fallback** — created `/apple-touch-icon.png` + `/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png` at the SITE ROOT (copies of the 180 emblem). iOS looks up `/apple-touch-icon.png` by convention across the whole site even when a page's `<link>` fails — the universal safety net.
2. **Dropped the `?v=3` query** on the apple-touch-icon `<link>` (some iOS ignore query-string touch icons) and added `sizes="180x180"` + a `-precomposed` link. **THE ACTUAL PAGE Grant adds from = `ffp-passport-landing.html`, which had NO manifest/apple-touch-icon/PWA meta AT ALL** → iOS had nothing to use → screenshot. Added the full PWA head block there (root `/apple-touch-icon.png` + manifest + apple-mobile-web-app metas). Also cleaned the same tags (root path, no `?v=`) in index.html, login.html, ffp-member-dashboard.html for consistency.
Files: NEW `apple-touch-icon.png`, `apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png` (repo root); **ffp-passport-landing.html** (added full PWA head) + index.html + login.html + ffp-member-dashboard.html. NO build bump needed (HTML head + static files). Netlify serves root static files directly (real file beats the SPA redirect). **iOS caches the home-screen icon at install** — after deploy, the user must DELETE the existing home-screen icon and RE-ADD (ideally close Safari first); the server change alone won't refresh an already-installed icon.

## LATEST — 2026-07-07 · SIGN-IN BUG — deleted member row held the auth user_id → "Account suspended" (DB fix, live; NO deploy)
Latest sign-up **Shohreh Bakhsheshian** (shohreh_b76@yahoo.com) couldn't sign in. ROOT CAUSE: she signed up, that first member row was ERASED (`admin_erase_member` → status='deleted', email anonymized to `deleted+<id>@ffp.invalid`), then she re-signed up (new active row). But the erase did **NOT clear `user_id`**, so her Supabase auth user (674a365e…) stayed bound to the DEAD row. `/api/auth/exchange` resolves the member **by user_id FIRST** (`byLink`), found the deleted row, and hit `if status<>'active' → 403 'Account suspended'` (index.js ~L1672) — her new active row (user_id NULL) was never reached.
FIX (both live, no deploy): (1) DATA — released the dead row's user_id and bound it to her active row (`860a54d8`); verified she now owns the link + 0 other deleted rows still hold a user_id. (2) SYSTEMIC — migration `admin_erase_member_release_user_id`: the erase now also sets `user_id = null`, so any future re-signup with the same email/auth user resolves cleanly instead of 403. She can sign in now. (Backend index.js unchanged; the guard at L1672 is correct — the bug was the orphaned link.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-07 · NATIONALITY TAXONOMY — now fully DB-DRIVEN (Admin edits auto-propagate) + Complete-Profile live re-fill (member FFP_BUILD 564→566; PRO_BUILD 127→129)
Grant: "when I update anything in Admin it should auto-push across the platform — that's the whole point," + "is the Complete Profile page showing correct?" Both addressed:
- **Passport ISO code is now DB-driven.** New column `taxonomy_items.code` (migration `taxonomy_items_add_code_and_backfill_nationality_iso`), backfilled ISO3 for all 63 nationalities. Both `ffp-taxonomy.js` files now SELECT `code` and hydrate `FFP_TAX.nationalityISO` (value→code) in `apply()`; the member dashboard links `window.FFP_TAX.nationalityISO = NATIONALITY_ISO` so the static map is mutated in place by the DB. Result: change/add a nationality's code in Admin → the passport country code updates everywhere, no code edit.
- **Admin editor gained a Code field** for the nationality list (`ffp-admin-taxonomies-loader.js`: `isNat` column + `.tx-code` input + `setCode()` → `update taxonomy_items.code`). So a NEW nationality added in Admin can have its passport code set there too — full self-service.
- **Complete Profile page FIXED** (`ffp-profile-complete.html`): `populateNationalities()` now rebuilds (preserving selection) and re-fires on `FFP_TAX_READY.then` + the `ffp-tax-ready` event (same pattern the gender field already used). Previously it built the `<select>` ONCE synchronously from the fallback, so live Admin edits didn't show. Now it reflects the DB list.
- **Cache-busts bumped** (these load with their OWN `?v`, NOT FFP_BUILD): `ffp-taxonomy.js?v=9→10` in member-dashboard + admin-dashboard + profile-complete; `?v=11→12` in Pro index.html; the Admin taxonomies loader had **NO** `?v` → added `ffp-admin-taxonomies-loader.js?v=2`. FFP_BUILD 565→566, PRO_BUILD 128→129.
- Verified: 63/63 nationalities have a code; all edited JS terminates `})();` (RULE 3 mount-truncation false positives on node --check). SYSTEMIC gap from the prior entry is now CLOSED — the ISO is no longer a hardcoded-only map.

## LATEST — 2026-07-07 · NATIONALITY TAXONOMY (superseded above) — all 63 verified + 3 static lists synced (member FFP_BUILD 564→565; PRO_BUILD 127→128)
Grant: "check all nationalities in the Taxonomy show in all places." VERIFIED: DB `taxonomy_items` list_key='nationality' = **63 active** (source of truth). The profile picker uses `NATIONALITIES = window.FFP_TAX.nationalities` — a LIVE reference that `FFP_TAX_READY` hydrates in place from the DB on load (`fill(T.nationalities, vals('nationality'))`), so the picker already shows all 63 (same in the Pro app, which hydrates identically; the Pro client form only DISPLAYS nationality text, no picker). GAPS were two STATIC lists that are NOT DB-hydrated, both 60 (missing **Azerbaijani, Bahrainian, Iranian**):
- `NATIONALITY_ISO` (ffp-member-dashboard.html, the demonym→ISO3 map for the passport country code) → selecting one of the 3 rendered **"XXX"**. FIXED: added `Azerbaijani:AZE, Bahrainian:BHR, Iranian:IRN`.
- `FFP_TAX.nationalities` fallback array in BOTH `assets/ffp-taxonomy.js` (member) and `FFP Professional app/assets/ffp-taxonomy.js` (pro) — offline safety net; synced to the DB's 63 (added the 3). (DB hydration already covered online.)
Files: ffp-member-dashboard.html (FFP_BUILD 564→565 + NATIONALITY_ISO), assets/ffp-taxonomy.js, FFP Professional app/assets/ffp-taxonomy.js + index.html (PRO_BUILD 127→128). SYSTEMIC NOTE: `NATIONALITY_ISO` is a static frontend map (taxonomy_items has no ISO column), so any FUTURE nationality added in Admin→Taxonomies will show "XXX" until its ISO is added here — worth moving the ISO onto taxonomy_items later. Member fix is the critical one (passport code); Pro fallback change is non-critical (no pro picker; DB hydrates).

## LATEST — 2026-07-07 · PASSPORT TEAM OVERVIEW — landing + pulse + Performance-of-Day (effort score) + aura-ring streaks + 11-athlete demo (member FFP_BUILD 558→564; DB LIVE, frontend awaiting Grant's commit)
PERFORMANCE OF DAY + AURA RING + 11-DEMO (FFP_BUILD 563→564; DB LIVE): (a) **Standout → Performance of Day.** Winner scored by **EFFORT = Σ minutes × HR-zone** (Z1×1 … Z5×5), from `activity_logs.metrics.hr_zones_ms` (WHOOP/Coros zone milliseconds). Card: SQUARE avatar, effort hero (aqua), min-trained + max-bpm, Z1–Z5 distribution bar + legend; the whole card is **tappable → `openPerfBoard()`** full-screen effort leaderboard (ranked, "You" highlighted, per-athlete zone bars). New RPC block `member_team_overview_add_performance_effort`: `perf_act`/`perf_mem` CTEs → `performance` (winner) + `performance_board` (all athletes today with HR-zone data). Falls back to the old standout card if no HR data. (b) **Streak = AURA RING** (brand): replaced the off-brand fire ring with a slim rotating brand-gradient ring + glow + flame pill; tiers **blue(<7)→aqua(7–13)→yellow(14–29)→coral(30+ best)**. (c) **Demo team grown to 11** athletes (added Kane R, Sef T, Manu K, Tama W) — all with benchmark trends, skills, streaks, and today's HR-zone sessions so the effort board has a real spread (winner Duane 321). All demo tagged `demo_seed`. Zone data was seeded onto today's demo activities (wipe note in the demo-data block still applies). NOTE — only wearable-synced activities carry `hr_zones_ms` in production; real athletes populate on their Whoop/Coros syncs.
(d) **WINDOWS = ROLLING LAST 24 HOURS** (Grant: "stats are from users in the last 24 hours based on the time zone of coach"). Migration `member_team_overview_last24h_windows` switched Performance-of-Day (`perf_act`), pulse `showed_up`, and `work` today/yesterday from `date_trunc('day',now())` (UTC calendar day — which wrongly dropped activities before UTC midnight) to `now()-interval '24 hours'` rolling windows. A rolling 24h is timezone-agnostic (same instant everywhere) so it satisfies the coach-tz intent without needing the coach's tz. Verified: 11/11 on board, winner Duane 321, Manu 292, Dylan 271; showed_up 11; active 985 min. (Streaks still use calendar-date islands; if strict coach-tz day boundaries are needed for streaks/cals7 later, store the coach tz and shift — not required now.)
TEAM PULSE + SESSION COUNTS (FFP_BUILD 562→563; DB LIVE): (a) Re-added the **Team pulse** horizontal scroll at the top of the overview (below the header): **Active time · 24h** (aqua), **Calories · 7d** (coral 7-bar mini-chart + total), **Vs yesterday** (▲/▼ % of active-min vs the prior 24h, green/coral), **Showed up** (N/members, yellow). Backed by a new additive `pulse` block on `member_team_overview` (`member_team_overview_add_pulse` migration): `active_min`/`active_min_prev` (24h + prior-24h duration_min), `cals` (24h), `cals7` (7 daily calorie sums), `sessions` (24h), `showed_up` (distinct members active today), `members`. Verified live for JLT: 5h55m / 3,201 cal / 7-day bars / 9 sessions / 7-of-7 showed up / −10% vs yest. (b) **Training focus bars now show the session count** on the bar ("N sessions") alongside the %. NOTE — streak indicator still shows the fire RING pending Grant's pick of the new BRAND concepts (mock `ffp_streak_brand_concepts`: A aura-ring / B flame-token, tiers blue→aqua→yellow→coral-best) — NOT yet built.

FULL-BLEED HEADER + FLAME RING + SKILL-INFO FIX + STREAK COLOURS (FFP_BUILD 561→562): (a) Team overview header is now a FULL-BLEED cover image to the very top of the screen (210px, breaks out of body padding via negative safe-area margins, square top / rounded bottom) with the back button (‹) overlaid top-left — the separate top banner (`.mt-ovhead`) is hidden in `#ffp-mt-ov` (kept in DOM so `#mt-ovtitle` refs don't null). Body gets `env(safe-area-inset-top)` top padding for sub-views. (b) Streak flame reworked from a rising SVG teardrop into a compact animated RING of fire hugging the avatar (two rotating `repeating-conic-gradient` ring layers masked to a band + blurred glow layer; `.ffp-ring`/`.ffp-ring.g`). (c) Streak colour tiers now blue(<7)→yellow(7–13)→orange(14–29)→**red(30+ best)** per Grant. (d) Skills-analysis ⓘ FIXED — it called `openDetailModal` which renders BEHIND the z-100050 team overlay (invisible); `skillInfo` now renders the level guide as a full-bleed in-overlay sub-view (back → Skills). Verified palette + ring via show_widget.

TAP-TO-TOGGLE (FFP_BUILD 560→561): Team-progress cards are now tappable — flip between the team-average TREND line and the INDIVIDUAL athlete BAR graph (`_ovBar`). Per-benchmark mode held in `W._mtProgMode[benchId]`, card repaints in place via `_paintProg()` (id `mt-progrow`), only when the benchmark has a real trend (≥2 pts); header label swaps TEAM AVG↔INDIVIDUALS, right chip swaps delta↔"N of C hit", a "⇆ Tap · individuals/team trend" footer cues it. New export `progToggle(id)`.
Grant approved the mockup direction over ~6 iterations ("this is the best layout so far" → "Build this, I'd like to see it live").
Rebuilt the member-side team Overview (`renderOverview` in `assets/ffp-member-teams-loader.js`) from a plain stack into the approved landing:
- **Header cover photo** (team.cover_url, crest = logo_url, name + N athletes + "active today").
- **Team progress** at top = horizontal scroll of per-benchmark cards. Draws a **trend line** (team-avg by date, target dashed, today dot, direction-aware ▲/▼ delta) when ≥2 dated results exist; otherwise **falls back to the existing per-athlete bar graph** (`_ovBar`). NOTE: JLT currently has only 1 dated result per benchmark → all 3 show the bar fallback until more results are logged.
- **Training focus** bars (kept).
- **The squad** grouped block: recent **activity photo strip** ("people being active"), a photo-forward **Standout** card (24h winner by mins+cals, falls back to 7-day if nothing today), and **streak flames** — profile photo inside a living CSS flame whose colour runs cool→hot with streak length (≥14 blue-hot / ≥7 orange / else ember). Grant currently = 35-day blue flame.
- **Explore** tiles → `openSkillsView()` (team skill spread via `_ovSkillCols` + level-guide modal) and `openLeaderboard()` (per-benchmark ranked list built from in-hand `fitness.bars`, direction-aware, "You" highlighted). `backOverview()` returns to the landing.

DB (LIVE): migration `member_team_overview_add_activity_standout_streaks_trend` — **additively** extended the `member_team_overview(p_member,p_team)` jsonb with `activity` (recent 12 logs w/ member photo + activity image + mins/km/cals/at), `standout` (24h else 7d winner {name,photo,mins,cals,sessions,window}), `streaks` (current consecutive-day runs ending today/yesterday, gaps-and-islands on `activity_logs`), and per-benchmark `trend` (team avg by `recorded_on`, 30d). All existing keys unchanged; verified live for JLT (cover+logo present, Grant streak=35, standout today 31m/171cal, activity_n=12, trend lens [1,1,1]).

Files (MUST commit BOTH together — the ?v cache-bust is FFP_BUILD, read at runtime by ffp-connections-feed-loader.js which injects the teams loader as `?v=window.FFP_BUILD`):
- `assets/ffp-member-teams-loader.js` (renderOverview rewrite + new helpers `_progCard/_trendSVG/_actStrip/_standoutCard/_flame/_catGrad` + sub-views `openSkillsView/openLeaderboard/backOverview` + flame CSS in `injectStyles`). Parses clean (`node --check`), terminates `})();`.
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html` — `FFP_BUILD '558'→'559'` (L4461).
FOLLOW-UP same turn (Grant reviewed Build 559 live): (1) **bottom space** — `.mt-ovbody` padding `16px`→`16px 16px 96px` so content sits higher on scroll (FFP_BUILD 559→560, L4461). (2) **Activity images** — the strip was showing gradient fallbacks because seeded logs had no photo; re-seeded with real `activity-photos` URLs so image cards show. (3) **Logo "not updating"** — DIAGNOSED + FIXED (DB, live). Root cause: the stored `logo_url` carried a `?v=` cache-bust ~5min OLDER than the actual logo file write (file overwritten 2026-07-06 16:05, url `?v` from 15:59) → the CDN kept serving the STALE cached image even though the file changed. This is the fixed-storage-path/overwrite trap; the coach app's own fix (v122, unique `…-Date.now()` key per upload → fresh URL every change) is already in the CURRENT loader (PRO_BUILD 127, lines 173/601 use Date.now + ffp-image-upload withV adds ?v) — so future logo changes on Build ≥122 self-bust. Two server-side fixes this turn: (a) **refreshed JLT `logo_url` + `cover_url` `?v` to now** → the current stored images show immediately on the Passport (no deploy needed; overview/carousel RPCs read the column live). (b) **Dropped the duplicate `pro_team_update` overload** — there were TWO (7-arg logo-only + 8-arg logo+cover); the 8-arg handles every call shape (omitted `p_cover_url` defaults NULL → coalesce keeps cover), so the 7-arg was removed to kill any PostgREST "could not choose candidate" ambiguity on save. Migration `drop_duplicate_pro_team_update_7arg_overload`; 1 overload remains. If the refreshed image is still not the intended logo, the last upload never landed a new file → re-upload once on Build ≥122 (unique key guarantees a fresh URL). NO frontend change / no PRO_BUILD bump this turn (fix already in 127).

DEMO DATA REMOVED 2026-07-07 (Grant: "remove demo seed accounts") — deleted all `note='demo_seed'` results, `source='demo_seed'` activities, the 9 `demo.*@ffp.local` member accounts + their team rows. Team back to the 2 real members (Grant, Duane); real data untouched. (Overview now sparse again until real athletes log data.)

DEMO DATA SEEDED (all tagged `note='demo_seed'` / `source='demo_seed'` — wipe with `delete from pro_benchmark_results where note='demo_seed'; delete from activity_logs where source='demo_seed'; delete from pro_team_members where team_id='70e3…' and full_name in ('John H','Bazz G','Dylan','Ayman','Genair'); delete from members where email like 'demo.%@ffp.local';`):
- **+5 demo athletes** added to JLT (John H, Bazz G, Dylan, Ayman, Genair) → team = **7 athletes**. Real `members` rows (email `demo.*@ffp.local`, minimal cols, no auth) + `pro_team_members` links. No email trigger on members (checked).
- **Benchmark trend** — 105 rows across all 7 on 5 dates (−28/−21/−14/−7/−2d) for Illinois/3km/Bronco, descending toward target → trend lines render (5 pts each) + 7 bars.
- **Activities w/ real photos** — per-member consecutive-day runs → streaks Grant 36 / Dylan 21 / Genair 15 / Duane 12 / John H 9 / Bazz G 5 / Ayman 3 (flame tiers ember→orange→blue all visible). Standout today = Grant (115m).
- **Skill assessments** — Ball handling + Plant Stability levels for all 7.

INCOMPLETE / next: trend uses seeded dates (real once athletes log over time); Skills-analysis is the same level-columns as coach (could grow into a richer team spread); Leaderboard is single-team benchmark ranking (no cross-FFP yet); **coach-side logo upload write-path** to check. Deploy = Grant commits both files → confirm avatar menu shows **Build 560** → open Community → a team card → Overview.

## LATEST — 2026-07-06 · PRO TEAM / COACH TRACKING — design LOCKED (Grant: "world-class") + Phase-1 DB LIVE
THE big priority (Grant): coaches track their team/players. Full design agreed over a long pass and signed off "world-class".
Building it for real now, in phases. **This is the source of truth for the Pro Team feature — read before touching it.**

WHERE IT LIVES: FFP Professional app (ffpprofessional.com/app). A team's screens sit behind a new "team" area with TWO tabs only:
**Overview** and **Players** (Benchmarks tab was dropped — marks live in Overview + per-player; creating a mark/skill will be a
small manage action, TBD). Theme = the Pro app light theme with a DARK hero (radial teal `#0f3b4a→#0a1a24`, cyan glow), Montserrat,
teal `#0a3e44` / blue `#2ba8e0` / gold `#FFCC00` / aqua `#37E0C6` / coral `#FF7A66`. Status colours: progressing green `#37b06a` ↑,
holding grey `#b6c1c3` →, needs-you red `#e24b4a` ↓.

THE 5 THINGS A COACH NEEDS (agreed): 1 doing the work (consistency), 2 getting better (fitness + skills toward marks), 3 what
they're doing (sessions), 4 who needs me + why (chase / change plan / push), 5 hitting the standards. All FIVE appear on Overview.

OVERVIEW (team, scrollable page, sections separated by 8px grey bands):
- HERO (dark) = **Fitness**: mark pills (3km/Beep/Bronco/Illinois; ACTIVE pill = YELLOW bg), big TEAM AVG (e.g. 15:20) top-left +
  ▼delta + "N hit", and a full-width **bar graph**: one bar per player in SQUAD ORDER (not sorted), bars ABOVE the dashed team-avg
  line = aqua (good), BELOW = coral. No "FITNESS·3KM" label (pill lit says it).
- **Doing the work**: Today / Yesterday / 7 days toggle. Today/Yest = single horizontal SCROLL row (scrollbar hidden) of avatars who
  trained (green ring + tiny activity-type icon badge), then a small "Not yet · N" group + Nudge. 7 days = avatars with a session
  COUNT badge + "Quiet all week · N". (No "Trained today" label text.)
- **Skills**: skill selector (Clean&jerk/Snatch/…); squad falls into 4 level COLUMNS (Developing/Competent/Proficient/Advanced) with
  the actual avatars in each; target level starred.
- **What they're training**: thick patterned bars per type (Team training/Running/Gym/Skill) with the COUNT written ON the bar
  ("16 sessions") + % at the end.
- **Who needs you**: 2–3 flags = avatar (status ring) + specific reason + MATCHED action (Nudge the absent, Review the plateaued).

PLAYERS (one card, top→bottom; switch player via the top strip):
- **Avatar strip** (horizontal scroll): every player, status ring + arrow badge (↑/→/↓); selected one enlarged + first name.
- **Marks hero (dark)**: big current PR + ▼delta, target ("2s away") top-right, full-width **dot graph** (each attempt over time,
  dots trending to a dashed target line, latest highlighted), mark pills UNDER the graph (active = yellow). NO name/position (strip
  shows it).
- **Streak / this week / last logged**: 3 tiles.
- **Skills**: per-skill 5-segment meter coloured as a SPECTRUM red→orange→green→blue→purple (level = its colour), label in that colour.
- **Recent activity**: 7-day overview tiles (sessions/distance/time) + horizontal SCROLL of recent session cards (verified, tap →
  full Passport activity card). No "see all".
- **Nutrition** (LAST section): "7-day avg N kcal · X/7" header + a 7-DAY DAY-SELECTOR (each day's kcal, "—" if unlogged) → selected
  day shown in a clean panel: day total + day macro bar + meals (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snacks with items + kcal pill, coloured meal
  icons) + Hydration bar. Coach taps a day to see exactly what they ate.

DATA MODEL — existing (verified): `activity_logs` (member_id, activity, category, logged_at, professional_id, verified, metrics,
distance_km, duration_*, photo_url) = doing-the-work + sessions + training-mix; `food_logs` (member_id, meal, food_name, calories,
protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g, logged_at, photo_url) = nutrition meals/macros per day; `pro_client_access` (professional_id↔member_id)
= the coach→member link. NEW (created this turn, RLS on, RPC-only):
  • `pro_teams` (professional_id, name, type, sport, logo_url, description)
  • `pro_team_members` (team_id, member_id→members, full_name, position, status)
  • `pro_benchmarks` (team_id, professional_id, kind measured|skill, name, description, unit, target_value, direction, target_level, active)
  • `pro_benchmark_levels` (benchmark_id, level_no, name, description)  — skill level defs (Developing…Elite + descriptions)
  • `pro_benchmark_results` (benchmark_id, member_id, value, level_no, recorded_on, recorded_by, note)  — measured results + skill levels over time
  • `member_water_logs` (member_id, ml, logged_at) + `members.water_goal_ml` (default 3000)  — HYDRATION.
NUTRITION HYDRATION UI — **BUILT this turn (2026-07-06)**. Grant: "Add the hydration in calorie tracker". Done in
`assets/ffp-calorie-tracker-loader.js` (header → **v16**), NO edit to the 1.8MB dashboard (shrink priority respected — card is
injected by the loader, not inline). What was added:
  • `member_water_logs` RLS mirrored EXACTLY off `food_logs_self`: `create policy member_water_logs_self on public.member_water_logs
    for all using ((member_id = auth.uid()) OR is_admin())`; granted select/insert/update/delete to anon, authenticated. (LIVE.)
  • Loader: state `waterMl/waterGoal/waterGoalLoaded`; `loadWaterGoal()` (reads members.water_goal_ml, default 3000),
    `loadWater(date)` (sums member_water_logs for that calendar day), `renderHydration()` (injects `#ct-hydration` card into
    `#ct-today-view` — brand dark card, blue #2ba8e0, progress bar + "X.X / Y.Y L" + +250/+500/+750 ml buttons),
    `CalorieTracker.addWater(ml)` (optimistic bump + insert `{member_id, ml, logged_at: ctLoggedAt()}` → member_water_logs).
  • Wired: render wrap now also calls renderHydration; loadFromSupabase loads goal + today's water; loadDayData reloads water for
    the viewed day (per-day, same as meals). Uses ctLoggedAt() so a back-dated day logs to that day.
  • Cache-bust: member `FFP_BUILD` **538 → 539** (ffp-member-dashboard.html L4464 — read this turn). Validated (node --check, parse OK).
  • This feeds the coach's Pro-team per-player **Nutrition → Hydration bar** (pro_player_nutrition Phase 2 will read member_water_logs).
  AWAITING GRANT: commit ffp-calorie-tracker-loader.js + ffp-member-dashboard.html; confirm avatar menu shows Build 539 on device.

BUILD PLAN / STATUS:

  Phase 3 — FRONTEND: **REBUILT to the 3 LOCKED designs 2026-07-06 — PRO_BUILD 102→103, awaiting Grant deploy.**
    ⚠️ HARD LESSON (Grant, furious, 2026-07-06): I built the Team screens by REINVENTING them instead of using the EXACT approved
    mocks — the header was un-blended, the Create page made up. FIX: I extracted the approved widgets from the session transcript
    (`3e7c65e9….jsonl`, via `python3` walking tool_use `widget_code`) — the locked ones are **pro_overview_fitness_header_v2**,
    **pro_players_full_card**, **create_team_v4** (v3 + Grant's tweaks: intro hero + 3 steps; Type = Sports team/Community/Friends group;
    Sport = searchable FFP_TAX.activities). ffp-pro-team-loader.js was REWRITTEN to render these pixel-faithfully (one white 360px card,
    blended dark hero header, active mark pill = YELLOW, 8px grey bands, Material Icons, patterned training bars, overlapping skill columns,
    dot-graph, spectrum meters, nutrition day panel + hydration). CREATE page replaces the bare empty-state. Manage lives behind tapping the
    team-name row (add player / new mark / new skill / new team / switch / rename) + inline record on marks/skills. Parse-validated (479 lines,
    reconstructed in /tmp because the bash mount TRUNCATES this file at ~473 lines — TRUST Read/Write, not the mount). RULE for next time:
    when a design was approved in-session, PULL THE EXACT widget from the transcript — never rebuild from memory.
    [superseded build note below] New `C:\Users\User\Documents\Claude\Projects\FFP Professional app\assets\ffp-pro-team-loader.js`
    (self-contained IIFE, entry `window.renderTeam()`, ends `})();`, parse-validated). Renders BOTH tabs to the locked mocks:
    OVERVIEW — Fitness dark hero (mark pills, active=yellow; big team avg + hit count; per-player bar graph, taller=better via direction-
      aware score, aqua>team-avg / coral<avg, dashed avg line); Doing the work (Today/Yesterday/7d segmented → avatar strip w/ green ring +
      check/count badge, "Not yet · N" + Nudge); Skills (skill pills → level COLUMNS with avatars, target level starred, "Not assessed · N");
      What they're training (thick bars, "Category · N" on bar + %); Who needs you (flag cards → jump to player).
    PLAYERS — avatar strip (trajectory ring ↑green/→grey/↓red, selected enlarged) → marks dark hero (big PR + Δ, target top-right, SVG
      dot-graph of attempt history + dashed target line, mark pills under active=yellow, ＋Log button); streak/this-week/last-logged tiles;
      spectrum skill meters (red→orange→green→blue→purple, tap level → assess); recent activity (7-day tiles + horizontal card scroll);
      NUTRITION (7-day kcal day-selector → tap a day re-fetches; day panel = total + macro bar + meals Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snacks +
      Hydration bar reading member_water_logs).
    MANAGE (Benchmarks tab dropped, creating stays): ＋ on Overview Fitness header → create mark (pro_benchmark_upsert measured); ＋ on Skills
      header → create skill + levels; ＋Log on a player's mark / tap a skill level → record (pro_benchmark_record); GEAR on team header →
      rename + roster (add via pro_team_candidate_members picker = the pro's Passport clients, remove via ffpConfirm); empty state → create
      first team; team switcher when >1. Reuses openModalShell + showToast + ffpConfirm.
    WIRING (index.html, all edits this turn): `_provLoaderSrc` +team; `renderPanel` +team; `#panel-team` section (after #panel-grow);
      PRO_BUILD 101→102 (+changelog). **NAV CHANGE (Grant this turn): Check-in MOVED out of PRO_NAV into the avatar menu; TEAM added to
      PRO_NAV (icon 'shield' — classic Material Icons, diversity_3 is Symbols-only so avoided) + PRO_BOTTOM (mobile) replaces checkin w/ team;
      added a Check-in `av-item` button in the avatar menu.**  NOT DEPLOYED until Grant commits ffp-pro-team-loader.js + index.html → confirm
      avatar menu shows Build 102 on device. VISUALS unproven on device yet (built to the approved mocks; expect a polish pass).
    RPC added this turn: pro_teams_list(p_pro), pro_team_candidate_members(p_pro) — both SECURITY DEFINER + assert_pro_owner, granted anon/auth (LIVE).
  Phase 4 — Hydration in the member Calorie Tracker: **DONE 2026-07-06** (see the HYDRATION block above — loader v16, FFP_BUILD 538→539).
  Phase 6 — COACH MANAGE PAGES (Grant "build these in so it's correct") — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (PRO_BUILD 104→105, awaiting Grant deploy).**
    All three replace the old plain modals with FULL-BLEED pages in ffp-pro-team-loader.js (rendered into #team-body, back → _load(team)):
    (1) CREATE TEAM (create_team_v5): 150px cover with "Add header photo" pill + logo crest w/ camera badge overlapping; both upload via
        window.FFPUpload.pick → **new `team-images` bucket** (public read; logo aspect 1 / 512², header 16:9 / 1280×720) → pro_teams.logo_url +
        cover_url. Fields preserved across re-render (S.cName/cSport/cDesc/cLogo/cCover). (2) NEW BENCHMARK: Measured/Skill toggle. Measured =
        TEMPLATE picker (benchmark_templates_list, FFPSelect) → auto measure(Time/Weight/Level)+direction (editable) + Target (m:ss→sec parse
        for time); "Custom test" → benchmark_template_save to coach's library. Skill = name + 5 **LOCKED** level names (Developing/Competent/
        Proficient/Advanced/Elite — coach edits DESCRIPTIONS only) + tap SET TARGET → pro_benchmark_upsert{levels[{level_no,name,description}],
        target_level}. (3) ADD PLAYERS: referral/invite link (GET /api/pro/invite?email=, copy/mailto) + searchable clients list
        (pro_team_candidate_members → Add/Added) . Openers rewired: teamMarkCreateOpen/teamSkillCreateOpen→_showBenchmarkPage; teamAddMemberOpen→
        _showAddPlayerPage. NEW DB (all LIVE): pro_teams.cover_url; benchmark_templates (professional_id null=global | coach-owned; RLS; 21 global
        seeds w/ measure+direction+unit) + benchmark_templates_list(p_pro)/benchmark_template_save(...) RPCs; team-images bucket + RLS;
        pro_team_create/update extended w/ p_logo_url+p_cover_url. VALIDATION: bash mount hard-truncates this loader at ~503 lines so full node
        --check isn't possible there — node validated L1–503 clean, Read confirmed L504–624 well-formed + ends })(). member_my_teams/detail RPCs
        smoke-tested earlier (seed deleted).
  Phase 7 — JOIN REQUESTS (Grant's join model) — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (PRO_BUILD 105→106, member FFP_BUILD 540→541, awaiting deploy).**
    Grant's model: someone signs up to the Passport via the coach's REFERRAL link (coach earns referral) → coach adds them (they have a Passport)
    → onto the team; ALT: a Passport holder can REQUEST to join. Built the ALT: DB `pro_team_join_requests` (team_id,member_id,status
    pending|approved|declined, unique(team,member); RLS member-self read). RPCs (SECURITY DEFINER): member_find_teams(p_q) (search teams by
    name → id,name,sport,logo,coach,member_count), member_request_join(p_member,p_team) (upsert pending; 'already_member' guard),
    member_my_join_requests(p_member); coach: pro_team_join_requests_list(p_pro), pro_team_join_decide(p_pro,p_request,p_approve) (approve →
    insert pro_team_members). Smoke-tested request→list→approve→member-added, seed deleted. UI — MEMBER (ffp-member-teams-loader.js,
    FFPMemberTeams.openFind): "Find a team" link in the Your-teams header + a subtle "Find your team →" line when they're on no team; full-screen
    search overlay (#ffp-mtf-ov) → results w/ Request/Requested. COACH (ffp-pro-team-loader.js): the gear team-settings shows "Requests to join · N"
    for that team with Approve/Decline (teamJoinDecide). NOTE the coach referral link is already GET /api/pro/invite (used on the Add-players page).
  Phase 8 — TEAM LANDING + always-on empty states (Grant) — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (PRO_BUILD 106→107, awaiting deploy).** ffp-pro-team-loader.js:
    The Team nav tab now OPENS on a LANDING page (_showTeamsLanding) = a list of team CARDS (dark cover w/ cover_url or gradient + logo crest +
    name; footer "sport · N players · N marks"; tap → teamOpen(id)→_load) + a dashed "Create a team". pro_teams_list extended to return cover_url
    + mark_count. Inside a team the hero top row (_teamIdRow) = BACK arrow (→ landing, stopPropagation) + logo (shows logo_url) + name; tapping the
    logo/name block → teamSettingsOpen. The fitness hero holds FULL HEIGHT with no marks (dashed placeholder + "+ Add a mark" pill via
    _barPlaceholder; TEAM AVG shows "—"); Doing-the-work / Skills / What-they're-training / Who-needs-you ALL render with quiet empty states (never
    hidden) — Who-needs-you empty = green "Everyone's on track". Validated: node parsed clean through my edits (mount truncates ~495; edits all
    earlier), tail unchanged ends })(). teamBackFromCreate + create "back" now return to the landing.
  Phase 9 — TEAM SETTINGS as a full-bleed page (Grant "settings layout is terrible; mirror Create") — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (PRO_BUILD 107→108).**
    teamSettingsOpen → _showTeamSettings (replaces the cramped modal): TALLER 185px header (create header also bumped 150→185) w/ Change-header
    upload + logo crest camera upload (team-images bucket, keyed by team id), Team name/Type/Sport(searchable)/Description pre-filled + editable →
    Save changes = pro_team_update(name/type/sport/description/logo/cover) then refresh pro_teams_list + _load(team). Below the divider: Requests to
    join (approve/decline, _teamLoadReqs), Roster · N (+ Add players → add-player page; Remove per row via ffpConfirm), and DELETE TEAM with an
    ffpConfirm modal → NEW pro_team_delete(p_pro,p_team) RPC (cascades results/levels/benchmarks/members/join-requests → renderTeam=landing).
    Removed the old New-mark/New-skill/New-team/Switch buttons from settings — marks & skills are ADDED from the Overview (+ Add a mark pill in
    the Fitness hero / + Add on the Skills header). Validated: node clean L1–489, Read-verified the settings helpers (490–514) + tail ends })() (L708).
  Phase 10 — BENCHMARK terminology + placement + add-players fix + Passport resilience (Grant) — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (PRO_BUILD 109→110, member FFP_BUILD 542→543).**
    (a) It is "Benchmarks" (NOT marks/skills). Add/remove now ONLY in Team Settings: new "Benchmarks" section (_benchmarksSectionHtml lists every
    fitness test + skill w/ its target; "+ Add" → _showBenchmarkPage; per-row delete → ffpConfirm → NEW pro_benchmark_delete RPC cascades
    results/levels). REMOVED "+ Add a mark" pill from the Overview hero and "+ Add" from Overview Skills (Overview view-only). (b) ADD-PLAYERS fix:
    pro_team_candidate_members was reading pro_client_access (2 rows) → now reads the FULL client list (pro_clients) LEFT JOIN members by EMAIL,
    returns has_passport; list shows Add for Passport clients, Invite (copies referral link) for the rest. (c) LANDING team cards taller (176px cover)
    + footer "N benchmarks". (d) PASSPORT "nothing shows" hardening: renderCarousel no longer BLANKS on an RPC error (falls through to the
    "Join your team" card); conn-feed onerror now logs a clear "[FFP Teams] loader failed to load (404?)…" so a missing NEW file self-reports.
    ⚠️ LIKELY ROOT CAUSE of Grant's "nothing after 3 deploys": the NEW file `assets/ffp-member-teams-loader.js` may not be committed to the Passport
    repo (ffppassport.com) — the wiring is correct; if that file 404s nothing renders. Verify it's committed alongside ffp-connections-feed-loader.js
    + ffp-member-dashboard.html (Build 543).
  Phase 11 — PASSPORT teams ROOT CAUSE + Pro Team Settings 3-tabs + fixes (Grant) — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (member FFP_BUILD 543→545, PRO_BUILD 108→111).**
    ★★ 545 — Grant showed the Community panel (local HTML preview) still blank of teams. Cause: renderCarousel bailed with `host.innerHTML=''`
    when there was no member id (no session in the preview / auth race). FIX: renderCarousel NEVER blanks now — with no member/session or no
    teams it renders the "Join your team" card as the floor (member_my_teams only called when mid+supabase exist). Icons showing as text names in
    that preview = the Material Icons font isn't loaded in the Cowork preview pane (renders fine on device); not an app bug. FFP_BUILD 544→545, conn-feed ?v→545.
    ★★ 546 — Community polish (Grant): (1) TAP DOES NOTHING fixed — the team detail overlay (#ffp-mt-ov) used z-index 6000, BELOW the app chrome, so
    it opened behind everything; bumped to 100050 to match the canonical activity-card overlay (find overlay → 100051). (2) Team card HALVED — .mt-card
    270→135px wide, cover 92→46, crest/fonts/footer scaled down, footer shows 3 avatars + a compact active/players label. (3) "Matches"+"Search"
    buttons MOVED under the "My connections" header (they're connection actions, not part of Your teams). (4) Removed the "Community" panel title
    (h2 in #panel-meet). FFP_BUILD 545→546, conn-feed ?v→546.
    ★★ 547 — "Join your team" empty card SIMPLIFIED (Grant): dotted-outline "+" circle with a faint team shield behind it + "Tap to find your team".
    ★★ 548 — the empty card "does nothing" fixed: the FIND overlay (#ffp-mtf-ov) was created with inline display:none and toggled by an `.on`
    class that had NO CSS rule → inline style always won, never showed. openFind now sets ov.style.display='flex' directly; closeFind sets 'none'.
    Also reshaped the empty state into a real CARD (150px dashed vertical card) instead of a full-width strap.
    ★★ 549 — Community "Your teams" card (Grant, final): DOUBLED back to 270px (270→135 was wrong) and the cover now shows the team's HEADER
    photo (cover_url), NOT the logo — migration `member_my_teams_add_cover_url` adds cover_url to the RPC; card() uses cover_url for the cover and
    the logo_url for the crest (initials fallback). FFP_BUILD 546→549, conn-feed ?v→549.
    ── FFP PRO player detail (ffp-pro-team-loader.js, PRO_BUILD 115): (1) selected-player AVATAR was clipped (players strip .ffpt-scroll overflow-x
    clips y) → added vertical padding (9/14) + align-items:flex-start so the ring + trajectory badge show fully. (2) BENCHMARK section now draws an
    EMPTY graph (faint dots/line + dashed target line) awaiting the first result (was a "No history yet" line) — _dotSVG empty branch. (3) RECENT
    ACTIVITY cards use the member's activity PHOTO as the cover (photo_url from pro_player_detail, already returned; fallback gradient+icon), and
    TAPPING a card opens an Activity MODAL (openModalShell: cover photo + name + distance/time/logged tiles) — teamOpenActivity was a debug toast.
    (4) NUTRITION capped to last 7 days (.slice(-7)). Validated the new teamOpenActivity + _dotSVG blocks via /tmp node --check; file tail = })().
  Phase 12 — PASSPORT team OVERVIEW view + Training Focus + rich Activity card (Grant) — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (member FFP_BUILD 550, PRO_BUILD 117).**
    (A) PASSPORT tap-a-team now shows a read-only TEAM OVERVIEW (Grant reframed: overview only, no per-athlete drill-down, avoids over-sharing).
    ffp-member-teams-loader.js openTeam → member_team_overview (NEW RPC, member-authorized: caller must be a team member); renderOverview draws,
    dark-themed: team hero (name · N athletes), Fitness benchmark graph (TEAM AVG + per-athlete bars aqua/coral vs dashed avg, empty-graph
    placeholder, benchmark pills via ovMark), "Doing the work · 7 days" avatar strip, Skills level-columns (ovSkill cycle), Training Focus bars.
    (Also created but NOT wired to a UI yet: member_team_players, member_athlete_detail — for a future athlete view.) Old renderDetail/dotSVG/ordinal
    left as dead code. Validated new block via /tmp node --check; file tail })().
    (B) TRAINING FOCUS (both apps): Overview "What they're training" → "Training Focus"; DB pro_team_overview + member_team_overview training CTE
    now group by a.ACTIVITY (not category) → shows the actual activities logged + sessions + team focus %.
    (C) FFP PRO recent-activity MODAL is now a full read-only Activity card matching the Passport: photo gallery (photos[]+thumbs), place, date/time,
    metric tiles (distance/time/PACE/calories/avg HR/steps), notes — via NEW pro_activity_detail RPC (owner-guarded to the coach's team athletes),
    fallback to the summary row. Validated via /tmp node --check.
    Deploy: coach = ffp-pro-team-loader.js + index.html (Build 117); Passport = ffp-member-teams-loader.js + ffp-member-dashboard.html (Build 550).
  Phase 13 — BENCHMARKS in Fitness Stats + athlete self-logging (Grant Q+reframe) — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (member FFP_BUILD 551).**
    Grant Q: where do skills/benchmarks show + how updated? ANS (verified): coach adds in Team Settings›Benchmarks; shows in team Overview
    (skill level-columns / measured team-avg graph) + each athlete's detail; coach updates a SKILL via athlete detail → tap skill → Assess sheet
    (pro_benchmark_record level). Athlete had NO way to log a MEASURED result (we'd removed the coach "+log"). Grant decisions: (1) MEASURED =
    ATHLETE logs from Passport (skills stay coach-assessed); (2) "Records could be renamed to Benchmarks… teams pull the details from this section."
    BUILT: (a) Fitness Stats tab "Records" → renamed "Benchmarks" (dashboard label; data-fs-tab still 'records'). (b) NEW self-contained "Team
    Benchmarks" section PREPENDED into the Benchmarks tab (fitness-stats-loader buildRecordsTabUI → #fs-team-benchmarks → renderTeamBenchmarks):
    per team, measured rows show Best/target + a yellow "Log" button → openDetailModal(m:ss or number + date) → member_record_benchmark (NEW RPC,
    inserts the athlete's OWN pro_benchmark_results row → coach's team view picks it up); skill rows show the coach-assessed level (read-only). NEW
    RPCs: member_my_benchmarks(p_member) (list across the athlete's teams) + member_record_benchmark(p_member,p_benchmark,p_value,date,note)
    (measured-only, membership-guarded). Validated new loader block via /tmp node --check. NOTE (future/plan): Grant's deeper reframe — fully merge
    personal PRs ⇄ team benchmarks (one source) — NOT done; this is the bridge (athlete logs here, teams read). Deploy: ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js
    + ffp-member-dashboard.html (Build 551).
    ★★ 552 — Benchmarks tab UX cleanup (Grant): REMOVED the "Team Benchmarks" title/text + per-team labels AND the metric PILL strip. Replaced
    both with ONE searchable DROPDOWN (#fs-bench-search + #fs-bench-list) whose options = built-in metrics (non-Health) + the athlete's team
    benchmarks (buildBenchOptions via member_my_benchmarks). Pick one → its card shows underneath: a built-in metric reveals the existing My PR
    card + filters + leaderboard (now wrapped in #fs-metric-content, hidden until picked); a team MEASURED benchmark shows a current/target card +
    "Log result"; a team SKILL shows the coach-assessed level read-only. ffpShowLeaderboard (Bio-Age health cards) updated to reveal #fs-metric-content.
    Validated new picker block via /tmp node --check. Deploy ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js + ffp-member-dashboard.html (Build 552).
    ★★★ 553 HOTFIX — "Fitness Stats not showing AT ALL": the 552 redesign DELETED the renderTeamBenchmarks function but LEFT its top-level export
    line `window.ffpRenderTeamBenchmarks = renderTeamBenchmarks;` → ReferenceError at load → the whole loader IIFE aborted → FitnessStats never
    initialised → blank panel. (node --check PASSES on this because an undefined *reference* is not a syntax error — a reminder that node-check ≠
    runtime-safe.) FIX: removed the stale export line (grep confirms 0 refs). Edit boundary clean (};→function buildRecordsTabUI). FFP_BUILD 552→553.
    ★ PASSPORT "Team section never shows" — REAL ROOT CAUSE FOUND (RULE 0, live-read): ffp-member-dashboard.html line 8467 loaded
    `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js?v=338` — pinned to build 338, ~205 builds STALE. The teams-carousel code (#cf-teams +
    ensureTeamsCarousel) lives in a LATER version of that loader, so the browser kept fetching the cached v338 copy with NO teams code —
    which is why 3 re-deploys of the committed file changed nothing (the HTML never asked for the new file). FIX: bumped that cache-bust
    `?v=338`→`?v=544` and FFP_BUILD 543→544. (The teams loader itself loads via `?v=FFP_BUILD`, so it now cache-busts too.) Only
    ffp-member-dashboard.html changed for this; the two loader files were already correct.
    ── FFP PRO (ffp-pro-team-loader.js, PRO_BUILD 111): (1) TEAM SETTINGS rebuilt as a 3-TAB page — Players · Benchmarks · Details — under a
    persistent cover+logo header (teamSetTab; SET_TABS). Details=name/type/sport/description+Save+Delete; Benchmarks=list+Add; Players=join
    requests+roster+Add players. (2) Both "+ Add" buttons YELLOW (new _yAdd helper #FFCC00). (3) Team logo DEFAULT bg WHITE (create + settings
    crest + .ffpt-logo chip; dark initials). (4) teamBenchBack/teamApDone → return to the relevant Settings TAB (not overview); _afterBenchSave
    refreshes overview+list then shows Settings›Benchmarks. (5) DESCRIPTION "not saving" FIXED — pro_team_update always persisted it; the reload
    was blank because pro_teams_list omitted description → migration `pro_teams_list_add_description` now returns it (+ cover_url + mark_count).
    (6) OVERVIEW header TALLER: _barPlaceholder now DRAWS an empty squad graph (faint bars + dashed avg) at full height even with no
    players/results; _barSVG's "no results" branch calls it too. (7) Terminology → "benchmark" (toasts; player-detail empty state no inline add).
    Validated: settings + _barPlaceholder + _afterBenchSave node-checked in isolation (mount truncates file at 501 lines — bash node --check is a
    FALSE positive; Read confirms tail = `})();` at L753). AWAITING Grant deploy: coach = ffp-pro-team-loader.js + index.html (Build 111);
    Passport = ffp-member-dashboard.html (Build 544, cache-bust fix) — confirm ffp-connections-feed-loader.js + ffp-member-teams-loader.js committed.
  Phase 5 — MEMBER SIDE: "My teams" in the Passport Community panel — **BUILT 2026-07-06 (member FFP_BUILD 539→540, awaiting Grant deploy).**
    Design locked with Grant over many iterations (kept the Community feed as-is): Community = "Your teams" HORIZONTAL-SCROLL of compact
    QUEST-STYLE cards (cover + crest + team name + Coach; face-pile of teammates; "N active" green pulse; movement chip improving/holding/
    slipping) → TWO YELLOW buttons "Matches" (FFPConnFeed.discover) + "Search" (FFPConnFeed.openSearch) that REPLACED the old two straps →
    My connections → Latest activity (unchanged). Teams row is ADDITIVE — renders nothing when the member is on no team (no empty box).
    Tap a team → FULL-SCREEN overlay (member-app convention, #ffp-mt-ov fixed inset:0 #0a1825): the member's OWN standing — marks dot-graph
    hero (their PR + Δ + target-away + mark pills to switch) + spectrum skill meters + SQUAD LEADERBOARD (ranked, "You" highlighted yellow,
    "You're Nth of M"). Day-streak/this-week intentionally NOT shown (Grant).
    NEW loader `assets/ffp-member-teams-loader.js` (window.FFPMemberTeams.renderCarousel/openTeam; parse-validated 185 lines, ends })();),
    lazy-injected by the connections-feed loader into `#cf-teams` (cache-bust ?v=window.FFP_BUILD — dashboard now sets window.FFP_BUILD).
    Edited `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` (straps→#cf-teams + yellow buttons + ensureTeamsCarousel + cf-ybtn CSS) and
    `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (FFP_BUILD 539→540 + expose window.FFP_BUILD). DB RPCs (SECURITY DEFINER, member reads ONLY own standing;
    guard p_member=auth.uid()|service|admin): `member_my_teams(p_member)` (teams + rank + trajectory + headline PR + active_today + teammate
    avatars + coach name), `member_team_detail(p_member,p_team,p_bench)` (own marks+history, skills, squad leaderboard w/ first-name+initial,
    is_you). Both smoke-tested LIVE then seed deleted (tables back to 0). Feeds off the SAME pro_teams/pro_team_members/pro_benchmark_* the
    coach writes — a coach adds the member (from pro_client_access clients) and it appears here. AWAITING GRANT: commit ffp-member-teams-loader.js
    + ffp-connections-feed-loader.js + ffp-member-dashboard.html (+FFP-MASTER); confirm avatar menu Build 540; open Community.
NOTE: mock renders of every screen were approved in-session (Overview fitness-header, doing-the-work 3 views, skills columns, training
bars, who-needs-you; Players avatar-strip + marks dot-graph + spectrum skills + recent-activity scroll + nutrition day panel). Build to those.

## LATEST — 2026-07-04 · POINTS DIAGNOSIS + quest leaderboard breakdown (member FFP_BUILD 535→536; quests-core ?v=17→18; NO DB change)
POINTS — "share points missing" DIAGNOSED (nothing broken in saving): share points fire ONLY from the Share button on an
activity/passport card → `ffpLogSocialShare`→`log_social_share` RPC → `social_shares` row → trigger `quest_after_social_share`
→ `member_action_log` (catalog `social_share` = 5 pts, daily_cap 3) → quest total via `quest_eval_auto` (counts only within the
quest's [active_from,active_to] window). Grant HAS 8 social_share actions (40 pts all-time); his breakdown shows Social share 6
pts (July quest) + 5 pts (Global) — the rest predate the quests' start (Jun 29/30) so don't count. Mike Bourne = 0 social_shares
(never tapped Share). ROOT UX GAP: the common "share to community" toggle (`activity_logs.shared=true`, 106 rows) awards NOTHING —
only the explicit Share-to-social button does. → OPEN DECISION for Grant: also fire the point on shared=true? (not built).
BUILT — quest leaderboard "where points came from": `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=18) leaderboard straps (`.q-lb-row`) now
clickable → `Quests.openMemberBreakdown(member_id,name)` modal, reusing `member_quest_points_breakdown` (SECURITY DEFINER, works
for any member) + existing `q-bd-row` markup + `q-ways-ov` overlay + a Total row. Dashboard FFP_BUILD 535→536, quests-core ?v 17→18.
EMAIL DELIVERABILITY (Resend): domains ffppassport.com + findfitpeople.com must each be verified in Resend with SPF (TXT+MX on
`send.` subdomain, `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all` + MX feedback-smtp.<region>.amazonses.com), DKIM (TXT `resend._domainkey`
= key from Resend dashboard, unique per domain), DMARC (TXT `_dmarc` = `v=DMARC1; p=none;` → tighten later). DKIM value must be
copied from each domain's Resend dashboard. STATUS (Grant's Resend, 2026-07-04): BOTH ffppassport.com + findfitpeople.com
show DKIM + SPF (MX+TXT on `send`) VERIFIED. DMARC still to add — Grant adding TXT `_dmarc` = `v=DMARC1; p=none;
rua=mailto:grant@findfitpeople.com` on both (GoDaddy for findfitpeople.com, NS1 for ffppassport.com).
MAILER (backend v159→v160): wrapped `mailer.sendMail` ONCE (after createTransport, ~L1137) so every outbound email gets
(a) a plain-text alternative auto-derived from the HTML when absent (htmlToText: strips tags, keeps link URLs) and (b) a
`List-Unsubscribe` header (mailto + the profile/prefs page) — all ~20 call sites, no per-site change, contract preserved.
Verified via heredoc (text derived + header set; node --check OK). Backend ends module.exports (L6529). DEPLOY: commit index.js
(v160) → Vercel. (Full one-click List-Unsubscribe-Post w/ a real POST endpoint = later; mailto/URL form added now.)
VERIFIED THIS TURN: ffp-quests-core.js node --check OK (full file); FFP_BUILD='536'; quests-core loaded ?v=18 (L332).
DEPLOY: commit `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 536) → Netlify.

## LATEST — 2026-07-04 · ACTIVITY CARD: COMMENTS + likeable comments + Stats/Comments TABS (member FFP_BUILD 536→537; DB LIVE, no backend deploy)
NEW social feature on the activity card. DB is applied + tested on live Supabase (assert_member_self guard blocks SQL-editor
calls — expected; works from the app with the member JWT):
- Tables: `activity_comments`, `comment_likes` (both RLS-on, access only via definer RPCs).
- RPCs (all SECURITY DEFINER, permission = owner OR a connection on a SHARED activity — mirrors member_like_activity):
  `member_activity_comments(p_viewer,p_id)` (list; each row carries mine/can_delete/like_count/i_liked),
  `member_comment_activity(p_me,p_id,p_body)` (add + bell to owner; 1000-char cap),
  `member_delete_comment(p_me,p_comment)` (author OR activity owner),
  `member_like_comment(p_me,p_comment)` (toggle heart + bell to the comment author).
- FRONTEND `ffp-member-dashboard.html` Build 537: `ffpRenderActivityCard` body split into a TAB BAR + `#ffp-panel-stats`
  (default: ribbon/zones/map/partners/notes/actions) and `#ffp-panel-comments` (thread + input); `ffpActTab` toggles.
  Comment rows have a small heart (ffpToggleCommentLike, inline update) + delete-X for author/owner; tab shows the count.
  Loaders: ffpLoadActivityComments / ffpPostActivityComment / ffpDeleteActivityComment.
VERIFIED THIS TURN: DB migrations applied (3 named migrations); insert→list→like→delete round-trips clean; comment/tab
functions node --check OK (75-line block); card-body restructure parens balanced; FFP_BUILD='537' (L4460); dashboard ends
`</body></html>` (L8908-09).
DEPLOY: commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 537) → Netlify. DB needs NO deploy (already live). Confirm avatar = Build 537,
open an activity → Stats/Comments tabs; on a shared activity a connection can comment + heart; owner/author get bells.
DONE (Build 538): Community › View Passport modal now has a REMOVE / unfollow button for existing connections —
`assets/ffp-connections-core.js` (?v=360→361) `MeetMove.removeConnection(uid)` → confirm() → existing
`member_connection_remove` RPC → `renderMatchStrip()` + `ffpRefreshLive(true)`. Built in the connections MODULE (not
inline in the dashboard, per the standing rule). Dashboard bumped FFP_BUILD 537→538 + loader ?v 360→361.
NOTE / OWED: the COMMENTS logic (Build 537) was inlined into ffp-member-dashboard.html — VIOLATES the "no new inline JS,
use a lazy assets/*.js loader" rule. Follow-up: extract ffpLoadActivityComments/like/tab funcs into assets/ffp-activity-comments.js.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · GROW = Grant's ROAD MAP (3 tabs, 8 steps/3 phases, world-class ring) + STEP 1 flow (PRO_BUILD 100→101 · BACKEND v163→v164 · DB LIVE)
FINAL structure after long design + IA alignment with Grant (he defined the spine). GROW is now a **road map**, NOT the old
11-foundations list. THREE tabs (Grant chose 3): **Road map** (default) · **Overview** · **Tasks**.
- **Road map** OPENS with an EXPLANATION screen (Grant: "make sure the road map begins with an explanation") — what it is +
  3-step how-it-works (answer → we shape it → lock it in) + **Begin** → then a ring TRACKER. **8 steps in 3 phases** (Grant's exact
  spine): **Foundation** → 1 Understand your strengths & weaknesses; **Setting up the basics** → 2 Ideal client, 3 Initial offer,
  4 How you'll deliver it; **Operational** → 5 Daily operations, 6 Sales funnel, 7 World-class sessions, 8 Look after clients;
  **Bonus (ongoing)** = keep current & upskill (card under the ring → opens Coach). Ring = **current step NEON YELLOW (glow), DONE
  teal, ahead faint** (Grant's colours — no multicolour/gradient), phase named above each step, ONE at a time, swipe chevrons, NO
  scroll. Intro auto-shows until a step is done; "How this works" link reopens it. Step 1 Start → `growStep1Open()` (the built
  strengths flow); steps 2–8 → "Coming soon" toast until their flows are built.
- **Overview** = the honest live pulse (`_growNowTab`, `pro_grow_pulse`) — real numbers → #1 blocker + today. (Grant wants richer
  business-strength metrics here next: LTV, retention, sessions, progression — NEEDS new calc/RPC, NOT built this pass.)
- **Tasks** = daily/weekly actions (`_growHabitsTab`, unchanged).
- **`assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` — full rewrite (267 lines, ends L266 `renderGrow()`; new road-map block node --check PASS via /tmp;
  bash mount STILL serves a stale 4823-byte copy — trust Read/Write).** Data model `GROW_STEPS` (8, with phase+plain+flow) +
  `GROW_BONUS`. Uses the generic `pro_grow_steps` store via `pro_grow_step_get('strengths')` for step-1 done state. Old
  FFP_FOUNDATIONS / foundation-articulate modal REMOVED.
- No DB/backend change this pass. `pro_grow_steps` + `/api/pro/grow/synthesize` (v164) from the entry below still ship.
- ALL 8 STEPS + BONUS NOW LIVE (Grant: "can't you put all 8 + bonus together in one pass?"). FLOWS now has 9 entries:
  strengths(1), ideal_client(2), offer(3), delivery_plan(4), operations(5), funnel(6), sessions(7), retention(8), upskill(bonus) —
  each 5–6 plain open Qs. A generic `outcomeGeneric` renderer shows {title, summary, points[{label,value}], note} for steps 3–8 +
  bonus (strengths + ideal_client keep bespoke renderers). Loader: steps 3–8 got `flow:'<code>'`; the Bonus card's `growUpskill()`
  now opens `growFlowOpen('upskill')`. Backend synthesize (v165): `GOALS` map + a generic branch builds the {title,summary,points,
  note} prompt for offer/delivery_plan/operations/funnel/sessions/retention/upskill; strengths + ideal_client branches unchanged.
  Script cache-bust `ffp-grow-step1.js?v=2→3`. Validated: engine 264 lines ends `})();`; FLOWS (9 keys) node --check + run OK; loader
  267 lines; backend generic branch L4403, ends `module.exports=app;` L6619. Bash mount still stale for both folders — Read/Grep only.
- (superseded) STEP 2 engine build — the step flow is now ONE reusable engine — `assets/ffp-grow-step1.js` rewritten to
  `window.growFlowOpen(key)` with a `FLOWS` config per step (questions + a per-step outcome renderer); `growStep1Open` kept as a
  compat wrapper (=strengths). FLOWS has **strengths** (Step 1, 8 Qs) + **ideal_client** (Step 2, 6 plain Qs: who / their struggle /
  tried before / winning / where / why you → result card: one-liner + problem/outcome/where/edge + note). Loader: step 2 gets
  `flow:'ideal_client'`, `growStepStart()` now calls `growFlowOpen(f.flow)` generically, and `renderGrow()` marks ANY built step
  done by looping the flow steps' `pro_grow_step_get`. Backend `/api/pro/grow/synthesize` is now STEP-AWARE (`v164→v165`): branches
  the system prompt on `step` — strengths keys unchanged, ideal_client returns {profile, problem, outcome, where, edge, one_liner,
  note}. Script cache-bust `ffp-grow-step1.js?v=1→2`. Validated: engine 187 lines ends `})();` (new code node --check + run OK via
  /tmp), loader 267 lines, backend ends `module.exports=app;` L6603. Bash mount STILL stale for BOTH folders (step1 showed old
  14345-byte copy; backend tail showed a mid-file email line) — verified via Read/Grep, not bash.
- OVERVIEW TAB NOW BUILT from REAL data + TASKS explained (Grant: "do the Overview tab and how does the tasks tab work?").
  NEW DB RPC (LIVE — `pro_grow_overview(p_pro)`, SECURITY DEFINER + assert_pro_owner): reads pro_clients / pro_payments / bookings /
  activity_logs / pro_grow_steps and returns active_clients, new_30d, revenue_all, revenue_30d, outstanding, paying_clients,
  **ltv** (revenue_all / distinct paying clients), **sessions** (bookings item_type='professional_session', non-cancelled),
  **retention_pct** (clients >90d old still active ÷ eligible; null if none eligible yet), posts_7d/30d, steps_done/8, **methods**
  (cash/card/… mix with %), **top_client** (name+AED), and a **focus** line (priority: no new clients → unpaid → post your training
  → finish road map → push growth). VERIFIED on a real coach: 11 active/11 new/AED15400 all·15400 mo/AED1000 unpaid/4 paying/
  LTV3850/0 sessions/retention null/8 posts wk/0 steps/100% cash/top=Ayman AED4800/focus=chase the AED1000.
  Frontend (`ffp-grow-loader.js`): Overview tab rewritten — focus hero + 3×2 metric cards + "how you get paid" mix bar + most
  valuable client + road-map progress (taps to Road map) + "work through it with your Coach" (seed now uses the overview numbers).
  Replaced the old pulse-reads Overview; `renderGrow` + the 2-min auto-refresh now call `pro_grow_overview`. Validated: Overview
  block node --check + run OK; loader 278 lines ends L277 `renderGrow()`. TASKS tab = the 7 grow_habit_catalog habits (2 daily:
  follow-up-lead, check-quiet-client; 5 weekly: ask-referral, invite-passport, celebrate-win, review-numbers, collect-review) with
  points + day-streak via pro_grow_state/pro_grow_toggle — unchanged, just explained.
- INCOMPLETE / NEXT: bespoke result layouts for any of steps 3–8 if wanted (currently generic {title,summary,points,note}); sessions
  metric reads 0 until pro sessions get booked through bookings. DEPLOY (Build 101): `assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` +
  `assets/ffp-grow-step1.js` (?v=3) + `index.html` → Netlify (avatar = Build 101); backend `index.js` → Vercel (GET / → **v165**);
  DB live (pro_grow_overview added). On device: Grow → Overview shows real metric cards; Road map runs all 8 steps + bonus; Tasks tick habits.
- STEP CONTENT REWORKED to Grant's spec + operational steps are now ACTION CHECKLISTS (Grant reviewed each step). Phases have two
  interaction styles: THINK (Q&A → AI result) for 1–4 + bonus; DO (dashboard-setup checklist) for 5–8.
  • Step 2 (ideal client) → builds a **client AVATAR**: Qs = who wants your skill set / age / gender / where they live / work /
    characteristics / their life / pain point. New avatar output {name, summary, age, gender, location, work, traits, pain_point,
    one_liner, note} + bespoke `outcomeIdealClient` avatar renderer.
  • Step 3 (offer) → **design the package**: Qs = result / method / where & equipment / format (length·frequency·duration) /
    assessment / nutrition / included / price. Generic output + backend HINTS ensure points cover all of these.
  • Step 4 (delivery) → **how you show up** (coaching presence, NOT tools): Qs = style / showing up (standards) / presentation /
    the client experience. (Tracking lives on the Passport, scheduling on the Pro dashboard — not asked here.)
  • Steps 5–8 → NEW **checklist engine** in ffp-grow-step1.js (`window.growChecklistOpen(key)`, `#gc-ov` overlay, `window.__gc`):
    each item ticks + a "Set it up →" button that `showPanel()`s the real Pro panel; step marked done via pro_grow_step_complete
    when every item is ticked; state saved in pro_grow_steps.answers.checklist. CHECKLISTS → operations(services/scheduling/packages/
    payments/clients), funnel(profile/clients + real-world items), sessions(scheduling/checkin/comms), retention(comms/clients/packages).
    Panel IDs verified from index.html (overview/scheduling/workout/clients/checkin/profile/services/packages/comms/grow/payments).
  • Loader: steps 5–8 gained `kind:'do'`; `growStepStart` routes `kind==='do'`→checklist, else Q&A flow. Backend GOALS trimmed to
    offer/delivery_plan/upskill (5–8 no longer synthesise). Script cache-bust `?v=3→4`. Validated: engine 303 lines ends `})();`
    (checklist + avatar node --check + run OK); backend HINTS L4389, ends `module.exports=app;` L6623. DEPLOY unchanged set + v165.
- SMART CHECKLISTS — operational steps 5–8 now AUTO-DETECT what's already set up (system-verified, like the member quest engine).
  NEW DB RPC (LIVE — `pro_grow_setup_state(p_pro)`, SECURITY DEFINER + assert_pro_owner): returns booleans services (pro_services),
  availability (pro_slots), packages (pro_packages), payments (professionals.charges_enabled|payments_status='connected'|
  stripe_account_id), clients (pro_clients active), profile (professionals.is_published), checkin (pro_checkin_schedules). VERIFIED
  on a real coach: services/availability/packages/clients/profile = true, payments/checkin = false. Checklist items carry a `detect`
  key; `clOpen` fetches setup state → auto-done items show a green check + "· done" and hide their "Set it up" button; manual items
  (referrals, social, network, invite, reviews, renew, winback, structure, comms) still toggle. `clAllDone` counts auto|manual.
  Script cache-bust `?v=4→5`. Validated: auto-detect logic node --check + run OK; engine 308 lines ends `})();` L307. No backend/build change.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · GROW REBUILT — lands on FOUNDATIONS (world-class ring, on-brand) + STEP 1 flow (PRO_BUILD 100→101 · BACKEND v163→v164 · DB LIVE)
After heavy design iteration with Grant, GROW now OPENS on a **Foundations** home he signed off as "world class". Design journey
(logged so we don't relitigate): chip-card → long-scroll ladder (rejected "SHIT scrolls") → focused one-at-a-time → plain-English
copy ("keep it simple stupid", cut helper text) → premium graphics (rejected my hand-drawn SVG as "amateur") → **Whoop/Strava-style
segmented RING** (Grant: "world class yes") → recoloured to **the Pro app's own light theme** (was a dark transplant): white card on
`--ffp-bg`, Montserrat, teal→blue→gold ring (`#0a3e44`→`#2ba8e0`→`#FFCC00`), deep-teal Start.
- **`assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` — full rewrite (262 lines, new-block node --check PASS, ends line 261 `renderGrow()`):** default tab
  `_growTab='foundations'`. `_growFoundationsHome()` renders the ring: `_growRingSegments(activeIdx)` draws all 11 arcs
  (done=`#2ba8e0`, active=gradient `url(#growRing)`+glow, upcoming faint), centre STEP/number/OF 11, swipe via
  `growFoundNav(±1)` (chevrons), `growFoundStart()` → Step-1 (`niche`) opens `growStep1Open()` (the guided strengths flow), the
  other 10 open the `growAnswer()` modal; order-gated (locked ahead). Each foundation has a plain-English `plain` title (Grant hated
  jargon). Tabs now **Foundations · Overview · Tasks** (Overview = the old NOW pulse, Tasks = old HABITS; the old Brand tab is gone).
  `renderGrow()` also reads `pro_grow_step_get('strengths')` and marks `niche` done from its outcome so the ring reflects Step 1.
- Wiring unchanged: loader cache-bust is `?v=PRO_BUILD` (101). No DB/backend change in this pass — the DB (`pro_grow_steps`,
  `pro_grow_foundations`, RPCs) and backend `/api/pro/grow/synthesize` (v164) from the earlier 101 entry below are still what ships.
- ⚠️ MOUNT STILL STALE: bash `wc`/`node` on `ffp-grow-loader.js` returns a cached 4823-byte/37-line copy — NOT the file. Verified the
  real file (262 lines, correct tail) with the Read tool + parsed the new block via /tmp. Trust Read/Write, not the bash mount.
- DEPLOY (Build 101, one commit set): `assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-grow-step1.js` + `index.html` → Netlify (avatar =
  Build 101); backend `index.js` → Vercel (GET / → v164); DB already live. THEN on device: open Grow → lands on the ring →
  swipe the 11 → Start on step 1 → the strengths flow → "Nail it" lights segment 1.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · GROW COURSE — STEP 1 LIVE "Know your strengths" (voice + AI synthesis) (PRO_BUILD 100→101 · BACKEND v163→v164 · DB LIVE)
Built GROW's first COURSE step — the guided way we actually get a coach to an outcome (Grant: "the only thing that matters is HOW
it's delivered… we need to get it FROM them… help them get to the result"). Step 1 = **Understand your strengths → identify your
audience.** Grounded in strengths research (Buckingham/Gallup SIGN, Hendricks Zone of Genius, Ikigai) and reframed per Grant:
NOT about coaching experience — about what they're good at, why, their knowledge, their experience (= the PROOF); thin proof → a
development plan. Questions are OPEN-ENDED, "explain in as much detail as possible".
- **DB (LIVE — migration `grow_steps_answers_outcome`):** `pro_grow_steps` (professional_id, step_code, answers jsonb, outcome
  jsonb, status in_progress|done; RLS on, RPC-only). RPCs `pro_grow_step_get` / `pro_grow_step_save` / `pro_grow_step_complete`
  (assert_pro_owner, upsert). VERIFIED this turn: save→complete→get round-trip returns status `done` with answers + outcome intact.
- **Backend (`index.js` v163→v164):** NEW `POST /api/pro/grow/synthesize` {member_id, step, answers} → `anthropicMessages` with a
  sharp warm-mentor system prompt → returns ONLY JSON `{strengths, proof, has_proof, audience_line, development_plan, note}`.
  Inserted before `/api/agent/execute`. File ends `module.exports = app;` (VERIFIED L6590 this turn).
- **Frontend (NEW `assets/ffp-grow-step1.js`, ~14.3KB, PARSE OK / 0 nulls):** `window.growStep1Open()` — full-screen overlay
  (#gs1-ov, z-index 4000, matches app full-bleed convention), 8 open questions ONE AT A TIME (strength → why → knowledge →
  experience → proof → your people → gaps → world-class), answered by TYPING or **VOICE** (webkitSpeechRecognition dictation
  appended into the textarea; mic button #gs1-mic; if the browser lacks it, tells them to type). Progress dots. On finish: saves
  via pro_grow_step_save, POSTs to /api/pro/grow/synthesize, renders the outcome (niche one-liner + strength chips + proof, OR a
  development plan when proof is thin) → "Nail it" (pro_grow_step_complete + refresh) or "Sharpen" (ffpCoachAsk). Exposes `__gs1`.
- **Wiring:** `index.html` — `<script defer src="assets/ffp-grow-step1.js?v=1"></script>`; PRO_BUILD 100→101 + v101 CHANGELOG.
  `assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` Brand tab — added a "▶ Start Step 1 · Know your strengths" launch button (calls growStep1Open()).
- DEPLOY: commit **backend `index.js`** → Vercel (expect GET / → v164); **`assets/ffp-grow-step1.js` (NEW) + `assets/ffp-grow-loader.js`
  + `index.html`** → Netlify (avatar shows **Build 101**). DB already live. THEN: open Grow → Brand → Start Step 1, answer with
  voice + text, confirm the AI returns your niche line / development plan, "Nail it" saves.
- INCOMPLETE / NEXT (await Grant's device confirm before starting): Steps 2–8 course content; the full Milestones/Tasks/Overview
  flow around this Step 1 template; live end-to-end test of the AI synthesize call (needs the backend deployed).

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · GROW FOUNDATIONS built (assess-first) + coach whistle icon + chat hook (PRO_BUILD 99→100 · DB LIVE)
Built the reframed GROW stage 1 (Grant: assess before tasks). The Grow section now OPENS with the FOUNDATIONS:
- **DB (LIVE — migration `grow_foundations_assessment`):** `pro_grow_foundations` (professional_id, foundation_code, status
  not_yet|getting_there|sorted, confidence 1-5; RLS on, RPC-only). RPCs `pro_grow_foundations_state` + `pro_grow_foundation_set`
  (assert_pro_owner, upsert). VERIFIED via /tmp isolated node --check of the loader logic = PASS.
- **Frontend (`assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` — full rewrite):** FFP_FOUNDATIONS catalog (10 + the "Lead by example — live it &
  post on your Passport" CORNERSTONE). renderGrow now shows: "Your focus now" card (first unsorted foundation + "Talk it through
  with your FFP Coach" button), stat row (streak/week), the foundations list (tap → assess modal: status chips + confidence 1-5
  + Save via pro_grow_foundation_set), then the daily/weekly habits below. growAssess/growSaveAssess/growFoundationTalk +
  _fa* helpers.
- **Coach chat hook (`assets/ffp-agent.js`):** floating launcher icon changed from the chat-bubble SVG to a WHISTLE (Material
  Symbols `sports`) per Grant ("change to coach icon"); NEW `window.ffpCoachAsk(text)` opens the chat + seeds a first message.
  "Talk it through" buttons in Grow call it with a foundation-specific seed. Cache-bust `ffp-agent.js?v=5→6` (index.html L1387).
- PRO_BUILD 99→100 + v100 CHANGELOG.
⚠️ MOUNT/FILE-TOOL DIVERGENCE NOTE (important for future sessions): the SHELL mount and the Read/Write/Edit file tools are
DIFFERENT views here. Bash `wc -c`/`node --check`/`fs.readFileSync` on `assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` returned a STALE 4823-byte
truncated view (and phantom null bytes) while the Read TOOL showed the real, complete file (ends L169). TRUST the Read/Write/Edit
tools for the deployed files; validate JS by copying the KNOWN source into local /tmp and node --check there (not the mount).
Do NOT "fix" phantom nulls by bash-writing to the mount — that writes the sandbox view, not the deployed Windows file.
GROW STAGE-1 PIVOT (Grant): the foundations FORM was "fucking stupid — no substance". Real stage 1 = a LIVE DIAGNOSTIC
("brain shrink") that reads where the coach actually is from REAL actions, tells them the truth, and holds them accountable —
"constantly updating throughout the day". BUILT:
- **DB (LIVE — migration `grow_pulse_live_read`):** `pro_grow_pulse(p_pro)` (assert_pro_owner) computes real signals — clients,
  new clients (30d), revenue collected + unpaid (pro_payments), the coach's OWN training posts (activity_logs via
  professionals.member_id — the lead-by-example proof), habits done today, foundations nailed — and returns an honest READ:
  4 area statuses (Getting clients / Leading by example / Money / Business clarity = strong|watch|weak), the single #1 BLOCKER
  stated plainly, and a TODAY accountability line. VERIFIED on a real coach: 11 clients/11 new/AED15400 in·1000 due/10 posts/
  0 foundations → getting-clients STRONG, example STRONG, money WATCH, clarity WEAK → blocker "your basics aren't clear yet…".
- **Grow panel (`ffp-grow-loader.js`, full rewrite):** default tab **NOW** = the live pulse (gradient hero with the blocker +
  today's accountability, 4 read rows with green/amber/red dots + metric, tap → coach that area, "Work through it with your
  Coach" → ffpCoachAsk seeds the AI with all the numbers for the deep diagnostic). Tabs **BRAND** (build-your-brand foundations
  articulation + stepped progress + blueprint) and **HABITS** (tick habits) behind the other tabs. Re-reads on every open (live).
- **DONE (this turn):** (1) BACKEND v162→v163 — `/api/agent/chat` resolves the pro by member_id, calls `pro_grow_pulse`, and
  injects the LIVE read into `agentSystem(role,ctx,pulse)` so the FFP Coach ALWAYS knows the real numbers — mentors direct,
  probes, names the #1 blocker, holds accountable, ends with one next action. (2) FRONTEND — `ffp-grow-loader.js` silent
  intraday auto-refresh: `_growRefreshPulse` re-reads the pulse every 2 min while the Grow panel is active + tab visible, and on
  tab re-focus (visibilitychange) — no loading flash. Both validated (isolated node --check PASS); backend ends module.exports L6561.
  DEPLOY: backend `index.js` → Vercel (v163); pro `ffp-grow-loader.js` → Netlify (Build 100). DB already live.
- NEXT: the comparison / gamification / leaderboard layer (effort-based, cohort/percentile, milestones — research-backed).
--- earlier GROW UX iteration (superseded by the pulse above) ---
GROW UX rebuilt after heavy Grant iteration (many rejections — "boxes are weak / not world-class"). FINAL = "Build your brand":
compact 3-TAB panel (underlined TEXT tabs, NOT pills), rich LIGHT theme with gradients + a dot pattern + depth (Grant: keep
light, boxes ok if not flat, use gradients/patterns/line-thickness). BUILD tab = gradient teal hero + a STEPPED-JOURNEY progress
(done steps = striped gold, your NEXT step = glowing white block, rest faint — "where you are / what's next") + a "Nail this next"
card (gradient top-edge + gradient CTA). You ARTICULATE each foundation in your own words in a MODAL (not a rating). BLUEPRINT tab
= locked answers on gradient accent rails. HABITS tab = the tick habits. DB switched to `answer text` (confidence rating removed).
DEPLOY (Build 100): commit pro `index.html` + `assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` + `assets/ffp-agent.js` → Netlify; avatar = Build 100.
DB already live. (Bundles the earlier undeployed 97/98/99 work too.)
OPEN (Grant, this session) — GROW comparison ANALYTICS + gamification/milestones/LEADERBOARDS + RESEARCH.
RESEARCH DONE (web, cited in chat): (a) Business — niche = specialists earn ~78% more; retention +5% → +25-95% profit; master
ONE pricing model before stacking; multiple revenue streams; 86% of 6-figure trainers do online. (b) Gamification — gamified orgs
~7x more profitable, leaderboards ~3.5x performance; people compare to those SLIGHTLY better to improve; instant feedback +
progress bars drive accountability; NUANCE (ScienceDirect) leaderboard effect differs by metric type → rank on EFFORT/CONSISTENCY
not vanity. (c) Brand/content — video #1; mix 30/30/30/10 (educational/inspirational/community/promo); client transformations =
best social proof; consistency on 1-2 platforms; IG mastery → CAC -67%, income +41% → validates the "lead by example + post on
Passport" cornerstone. DESIGN PRINCIPLES for the GROW comparison layer: rank coaches on EFFORT they control (habits done,
foundations sorted, own-training posts, consistency streak) NOT revenue (privacy + shame + not fully in their control); use
PERCENTILE / "coaches like you" benchmarking + show the ones just ahead ("here's what the ones succeeding did more of"); MILESTONES
/badges for instant feedback; hold LEADERBOARDS until the coach base is bigger (only 4 pros now — start with milestones + a
personal + FFP-average benchmark, add cohort leaderboards as volume grows). PROPOSAL in chat; awaiting Grant go to build the
benchmark+milestones slice.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · GROW VISION ADD (Grant) — the 730-DAY BRAND JOURNEY + LEAD BY EXAMPLE (post on the Passport)
Grant layered the overarching frame for GROW: we direct the professional to BUILD A BRAND over **730 days (2 years)**. Core to
it = **living true / being a leader** — the coach embodies their discipline (running coaches run, football coaches play football,
fat-loss coaches are lean) — and **they post this on their own FFP Passport**. So the coach's own Passport activity IS their brand
proof + content + credibility, and it reinforces "professionals must be active Passport members" (earlier thread).
HOW IT FITS GROW (to fold into the blueprint):
- **730-day journey = the container.** GROW isn't just foundations + daily habits; it's a 2-year arc to build a recognised brand
  + sustainable business, with phases/milestones. Foundations (the 10) = the early stage; habits = momentum between moves.
- **New cornerstone pillar: "Lead by example — live it and post it."** What "sorted" looks like: you train in your own discipline
  consistently AND log/share it on your Passport; your coach profile visibly shows you living the lifestyle. Question: "Are you
  logging and sharing your own training on the Passport?" This becomes an ongoing GROW thread, not a one-off.
- **Product tie-in (later builds):** surface the coach's OWN activity_logs/streak on their pro profile + as a GROW metric
  ("your consistency", "posts this month"); nudge coaches (coach-nudges cron) to post; their content feeds the community =
  supply-side engagement + Passport growth. The coach is a member too (same login) — this is already true.
TO DO: fold the 730-day arc + the lead-by-example pillar into `FFP-GROW-Foundations-Checklist.docx` (or a short GROW journey
addendum). Awaiting Grant: update the blueprint doc, or start building Foundations stage 1-2.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · GROW REFRAME (Grant) — ASSESS FIRST (Foundations), THEN tasks · doc delivered
Grant's steer: GROW must NOT open with a task list. Stage 1 = a DIAGNOSTIC — ask the right questions to understand the coach's
strengths / weaknesses / opportunities + CONFIDENCE, get the FOUNDATIONS sorted, THEN set small-win tasks matched to ability.
The P1 habits I built are actually a LATER momentum layer, not the entry point.
- Delivered **`FFP-GROW-Foundations-Checklist.docx`** (Building FFP Passport folder) — the blueprint: 10 foundations (niche, offer,
  pricing, profile, onboarding, payments, delivery, lead-gen, retention, social proof) each with "what sorted looks like" + the
  diagnostic question; a 2-min assessment (Sorted/Getting there/Not yet + confidence 1-5) → Foundation Map (strengths/gaps/shaky);
  sequencing rules (fix foundations before tactics; start with a win; one focus at a time; match tasks to confidence; unlock as
  they go); in-app layout (Foundations map + "Your focus now" + "Talk it through" → FFP Coach chat); build order steps 1-5.
- The **FFP Coach chat is where the questions/coaching happen** (reuses the existing pro agent, already a business coach).
NEXT BUILD (awaiting Grant go): Foundations stage 1-2 — the Foundation map + assessment + "Your focus now" in the Grow panel
(supersedes habits-as-entry; habits move below). Not yet built — this is a spec/checklist deliverable for review first.
NOTE: GROW P1 code (Build 99, habits + streak) is complete + CLEAN (grow loader null-byte padding from an earlier shrink-edit
was found + fixed via truncating rewrite; 0 nulls, parses). The P2 "Ask your FFP Coach" chat-hook edit was NOT applied (superseded
by this reframe). Build 99 still awaits Grant's deploy (commit index.html + assets/ffp-grow-loader.js).

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · GROW v1 — BUSINESS MENTORSHIP PHASE 1 (business habits + streak) (PRO_BUILD 98→99 · DB migration LIVE)
First build of the GROW spec (business mentorship). Points the FFP member habit/streak engine at the COACH's business.
- **DB (LIVE — migration `grow_phase1_business_habits`):** `grow_habit_catalog` (code,title,description,goal,frequency,points,sort;
  RLS on, RPC-only) seeded with **7 starter habits** — daily: follow_up_lead, check_quiet_client; weekly: ask_referral,
  invite_passport, celebrate_win, review_numbers, collect_review. `pro_grow_log` (professional_id, habit_code, done_on;
  unique per pro/habit/day; RLS on). RPCs (assert_pro_owner): **`pro_grow_state(p_pro)`** → habits[] with per-habit `done`
  (daily=today, weekly=this ISO-week), `streak` (consecutive days with ≥1 completion, grace to yesterday), `week_done`,
  `week_points`; **`pro_grow_toggle(p_pro,p_code)`** → toggles today's/this-week's completion. Grants to authenticated+service_role.
- **Frontend:** NEW lazy loader **`assets/ffp-grow-loader.js`** (`renderGrow`/`growToggle`, `_growProvId`/`_growEsc`/`_growToast`)
  — streak+week stat row, "Do today" (daily) + "This week" (weekly) tick-to-complete lists (teal filled check when done, points
  chip). Wired into `index.html`: `_provLoaderSrc.grow`, `renderPanel` grow branch, `PRO_NAV_EXTRA` grow, avatar-menu item
  ("Grow your business", placed FIRST for prominence), `#panel-grow` section (#grow-body). Keeps index.html lean (logic in the
  asset, per the shrink directive).
- **Passport lean / sales:** several habits ARE Passport-growth actions (invite a client, celebrate a win, ask for a review) →
  GROW also drives sign-ups + reviews. Real value, not a blanket prompt.
- **VERIFIED live (rolled back):** toggled follow_up_lead + ask_referral for a real pro → state returned streak=1,
  week_points=25, week_done=2, habits_done=2/7 (correct). Isolated node --check of the loader = PASS; loader terminates with
  init line. All 5 index.html wiring points confirmed via grep. PRO_BUILD 98→99 + v99 CHANGELOG.
DEPLOY: commit pro `index.html` + NEW `assets/ffp-grow-loader.js` → Netlify; avatar = Build 99. DB already live. Open the avatar
menu → "Grow your business".
NEXT (GROW phases): P2 AI business mentor (nudges from real numbers, reuse /api/agent + coach-nudges); P3 mentorship playbooks;
P1.5 habit on/off customization + surface a Grow streak card on the Overview home; P4 partner catalog.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · SESSION OPTIONS = SIMPLE session/slot model + MOVE A CLIENT (PRO_BUILD 97→98 · DB migration LIVE)
Grant rejected v97's "grouped by scope" session-options design as still confusing ("Reschedule/Block/Shift… what the fuck").
His model (confirmed): there are TWO objects — the **SLOT** (the standing weekly time: you USE it or DELETE it, never
move/edit it) and the **SESSION** (one date: add/remove/**move** a client, and block it). Rebuilt to exactly that:
- **Session options sheet** (`ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js`, the occurrence-options modal) now shows only:
  **This session · <date>** → "Manage clients" (add/remove/move) + "Block this session"; **This slot · the weekly time** →
  "Delete slot". DROPPED entirely: Reschedule just this week, Shift this slot from now on, Edit standing slot, Add to Google
  Calendar (all superseded — to change a slot you delete + recreate). Reused the v97 `opt()`/`secTitle()` row helpers.
- **Move a client to another slot (NEW):** "Manage clients" modal (was titled "Recurring clients", now "Manage clients") gains
  a "Move a client to another slot" button → `openMoveClient(fromSlot)` → pick client (from this slot's recurring clients) +
  pick target slot (the coach's other active slots, labelled via new `_dayName`/`_slotLabel`) → `doMoveClient` calls NEW atomic
  RPC **`pro_move_slot_client(p_pro,p_from,p_to,p_client)`** (SECURITY DEFINER, assert_pro_owner; deletes the pro_slot_clients
  row on the source, inserts on the target; guards same-slot / ownership / client). Migration `pro_move_slot_client` — **LIVE**.
- **Delete-slot confirm** upgraded from the old openModalShell 'End this slot?' to branded `ffpConfirm` (danger).
- **VERIFIED live (rolled back):** picked a real pro with ≥2 slots + a recurring client, ran pro_move_slot_client →
  still_in_from=0, now_in_to=1 (correct). Isolated node --check of the new session-options + move funcs = PASS. File terminates
  correctly THIS turn: init L499 (RULE 3.1). Rendered final layout (show_widget). PRO_BUILD 97→98 + v98 CHANGELOG (supersedes v97).
DEPLOY: commit pro `index.html` + `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` → Netlify; avatar = Build 98. (This bundles the v97
recurring-clients search/A–Z/font + "Progress check-ins" rename, which were never separately deployed.) DB already live.
NOTE: `openReschedule` / `openSlotModal` / `proAddOccToCal` still exist in the loader (just no longer surfaced in this sheet) —
harmless dead-ish entry points; can prune later if desired.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · SCHEDULING UX (2) + "Progress check-ins" rename (PRO_BUILD 96→97)
Grant (screenshots): the "Session options" sheet is confusing; the "Recurring clients" list needs search + A–Z + bigger font.
Both fixed in `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js`:
- **Session options redesigned** (`openSlotOccOptions` body): the 6 look-alike full-width buttons are now GROUPED BY SCOPE with a
  one-line explanation on each. Local `opt(icon,label,sub,onclick,variant)` + `secTitle()` helpers. Layout: primary "Add or
  remove people"; section **"Just this session · <date>"** (Add to Google Calendar / Reschedule just this week / Block this
  date); section **"The standing slot · every week"** (Shift this slot from now on / Edit standing slot). Kills the ambiguity
  over which actions hit one date vs every week.
- **Recurring-clients list** (`openSlotPeople`): now A–Z sorted (`localeCompare`), a Search input (shown when >6 clients,
  `oninput="_slpFilter()"` live-filters `.slp-row` by data-name; hidden rows keep their checked state so selections are
  preserved), and bigger rows (16px name, 20px checkbox, 12px padding). New top-level `_slpFilter()`.
- **Rename:** client-profile "Check-ins" tile → **"Progress check-ins"** (+ modal titles) to disambiguate from the attendance
  "Check in a client" nav panel (which is QR/code attendance, a different thing). Folded into the Build-96 check-in code.
Validated: isolated node --check of BOTH edited regions = PASS (RULE 3 — bash `cp`/read truncates this file at ~L450, so the
whole-file check was a false error; edited regions are <L350 and verified). File terminates correctly THIS turn: init call
L478 (RULE 3.1). Rendered both modals (show_widget) to verify layout. PRO_BUILD 96→97 (index.html) + v97 CHANGELOG note.
DEPLOY: commit pro `index.html` + `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` (carries the
"Progress check-ins" rename) → Netlify; avatar = Build 97. (Build 96 already deployed by Grant — backend v162 + DB live.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · COACH AUTOMATIONS v1: RECURRING CHECK-INS (PRO_BUILD 95→96 · BACKEND v161→v162 · DB migration LIVE)
First build from the coach-ops gap analysis (P0 #1). Coaches can now schedule a check-in FORM to auto-send to a client on a
cadence — no manual chasing. Full vertical slice:
- **DB (LIVE — migration `coach_automations_v1_checkin_schedules` applied):** table `pro_checkin_schedules`
  (professional_id, client_id, template_id, cadence weekly|fortnightly|monthly, next_due date, active, last_sent_at). RLS
  enabled, no anon policies (access via SECURITY DEFINER RPCs only, matching other pro_* tables). RPCs (assert_pro_owner):
  `pro_save_checkin_schedule`, `pro_list_checkin_schedules`, `pro_delete_checkin_schedule`. Cron RPC `pro_run_due_checkins(p_today)`
  (service_role/admin only) finds due schedules, **reuses `pro_assign_form`** (assigns the form + notifies the client via
  bell/push/email — same path the manual "Assign form" uses) and advances next_due by cadence in a loop (one send per period,
  no backlog spam). Helper `_checkin_interval(cadence)`.
- **Backend (awaiting Grant commit → Vercel):** `GET /api/cron/coach-automations` (CRON_SECRET-gated, mirrors /api/cron/lifecycle)
  calls pro_run_due_checkins(today). Registered in nested `vercel.json` crons at `0 8 * * *` (daily 08:00 UTC). BACKEND_VERSION
  v161→v162 (index.js — read this turn, comment + const both updated).
- **Pro app (awaiting Grant commit → Netlify):** new **"Check-ins"** tile in the client profile (`_fiveButtons`, icon
  event_repeat) → `openCheckinSchedule(id)` modal: lists active check-ins (template · cadence · next due · delete via ffpConfirm)
  and an "Add a check-in" form (template select + cadence + first-date). `saveCheckinSchedule` / `ckDelete` / `ckDoDelete`.
  **Passport lean (real value, not a sales gimmick):** if the client isn't linked to a Passport member
  (`pro_client_access_status.member_id` null) the modal shows an invite prompt (reuses `proCopyInviteLink`) — check-ins only
  reach Passport holders. PRO_BUILD 95→96 + v96 CHANGELOG note.
- **VERIFIED live (rolled back):** seeded an overdue weekly schedule for a Passport-linked client → ran pro_run_due_checkins →
  1 form assigned + 1 member notification created + next_due advanced 20-days-overdue → next week (single send). Isolated
  node --check PASS on the cron endpoint + the check-in UI funcs. All files terminate correctly THIS turn (RULE 3.1):
  client-loader init L1131, backend `module.exports = app;` L6547, index.html unchanged tail, vercel.json valid JSON.
DEPLOY: (1) commit backend `index.js` + `vercel.json` → Vercel (adds the cron; Vercel schedules it). (2) commit pro
`index.html` + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` → Netlify; avatar = Build 96. DB already live.
NEXT SLICE (Coach Automations v2): onboarding sequence — auto-assign intake form(s) + optional Passport invite when a client
is added. Then P0 #2 (scheduled/automated messages + expiry reminders) and P0 #3 (exercise demo-video library).

⚠️ SECURITY ADVISORY (surfaced by DB advisor, PRE-EXISTING — not from this build): tables `quest_task_catalog` and
`member_action_log` have **RLS disabled** → readable/writable by anyone with the anon key. Do NOT blanket-enable (would break the
quest engine which reads them). Decision for Grant: add scoped policies (e.g. read-only for authenticated on quest_task_catalog;
member-owns-row on member_action_log) — happy to spec + apply. Logged here so it isn't lost.

★ NEW STRATEGIC IDEA (Grant, 2026-07-05) — **BUSINESS MENTORSHIP for pros/partners.** "Every professional or partner simply
wants to build their business… a business mentorship section that guides them toward success… business daily HABITS that
strengthen the business… a massive buy-in." Fits the FFP DNA (we already run daily habits/streaks/nudges member-side — mirror
that for the COACH's business). Candidate: a "Grow" section in the pro/partner dashboard = business daily habits + streaks
(e.g. "message a lapsed client", "post one win", "follow up a lead"), short mentorship lessons/playbooks, and AI "FFP Coach"
business guidance (the /api/agent + coach infra already exists). Positions FFP Pro as a business partner, not just admin tooling
= retention + word-of-mouth. TO SPEC next (Grant keen). See its own section when scoped.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · PRO WORLD-CLASS CONFIRMS + CLIENTS HEADER + SERVICE-FIELD INFO (PRO_BUILD 94→95)
Grant (screenshots): the confirmation modals "look like any other page, small writing hard to read — needs world-class";
Clients search+buttons layout "terrible" (wants search full-width, buttons beside each other); Edit-service fields need
info icons. Mockup shown + approved ("yes! Much better!"). Shipped all three:
1. **Branded `ffpConfirm()` dialog** (NEW, index.html) — centered card, colored icon circle (red `#d64545` for destructive /
   teal purple for neutral), 18px bold title, 14px readable body, big Cancel + danger/teal action buttons. Returns a
   Promise<boolean> (`await ffpConfirm({title,body,confirm,danger,icon})` or `.then`). Helpers `ffpConfirm` /
   `ffpConfirmResolve` + `#ffp-confirm` overlay + `.btn-danger` CSS. **Replaced EVERY confirmation in the pro app** — both the
   weak full-screen `openModalShell('',…)` card confirms AND all native `confirm()`/`window.confirm()` (all enclosing fns were
   already async → clean `if(!(await ffpConfirm(…)))return;`; sync ones signOut/clearProNotifs use `.then`). Sites converted:
   client-loader ×8 (delete member/plan/broadcast/workout cards + note/form/template/cancel-package guards), billing ×3
   (delete payment card + bank/invoice/record guards), scheduling ×6 (pause/save-people/reschedule/block/return-credit/refund),
   index.html ×4 (signOut, clearProNotifs, proCalDisconnect, + shared def), services ×1 (archive). Left as-is (real form/info
   modals, NOT confirms): markPaid, "AI draft a workout", "Return credits / refunds", "No clients yet".
2. **Clients header** (index.html #panel-clients) — search input now FULL WIDTH on its own row; "Add client" (`btn-pri`) +
   "Invite to Passport" (`btn-sec`) side by side (`flex:1`) beneath, with the referral caption under them. Removed
   `_proInviteBtnHtml` + its injection in `renderMembersList` (client-loader) — invite is single-source in the header now,
   calls existing `proCopyInviteLink`.
3. **Edit-service field info** (services-loader) — each field label carries a tappable info icon → branded `ffpInfoPop`
   popover (`#ffp-tip` layer + `.fld-i` icon CSS in index.html) explaining what to enter and why (name, type, session length,
   capacity, price, free-cancellation, location, description, offer-online). Shared `_svcInfo(title,body)` helper (text escaped
   into data-* attrs).
Validated: isolated node --check of the new helper block + await-form guards + `_svcInfo` template = PASS (RULE 3 — bash/python
truncate these mounted files + flag them binary on non-ASCII, so counts came from Read/Grep, not bash). All 5 files verified to
TERMINATE correctly THIS turn (RULE 3.1): index.html `</html>` L1380, client-loader init L1077, scheduling init L462, billing
init L294, services `}` L147. PRO_BUILD 94→95 (index.html L668, read this turn) + v95 CHANGELOG note prepended.
DEPLOY: commit `index.html` + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` + `ffp-professional-billing-loader.js` +
`ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` + `ffp-professional-services-loader.js` → Netlify (pro repo → ffpprofessional.com);
confirm avatar menu shows **Build 95**. This clears the FFP-MASTER backlog item "unify native confirm() → branded modal".
STILL OPEN (unchanged, lower priority): link Bank Details↔Stripe cards; one-off-payment gate (PRODUCT-INTENT — needs Grant's OK);
mis-tap adjacency (Mark-paid next to View-send); impact COUNTS in destructive modals (e.g. "3 clients assigned").

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · PRO UX FLOW (2) — Add-client modal reorder + Scheduling-people confirm wording (PRO_BUILD 93→94)
Two of the "STILL OPEN" UX items from Build 93 cleared:
- **Add/Edit-client modal reorder** (`ffp-professional-client-loader.js`, `openMemberModal` ~L466-471): Client **email**
  input + **"Pull from FFP Passport"** button now render FIRST (a `form-section` of their own), then the Client name grid
  (Given names / Surname / phone …). Previously the Pull button sat above the form while the email it depends on was buried
  mid-grid, so the natural flow (type email → tap Pull → auto-fill) read backwards. Email removed from the lower grid (no dup).
- **Scheduling "who's in this session" confirm reworded** (`ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` L136, `saveSlotPeople`):
  now `"Save changes to who's in this session? Anyone you removed will lose their spot."` (was generic) — names the impact.
Validated: isolated node --check of extracted `openMemberModal` OK; quote/paren balance even; all 3 files verified to
TERMINATE correctly THIS turn (RULE 3.1) — client-loader ends L1077 init call, scheduling-loader L462 init call, index.html
`</html>` L1335. Bump: PRO_BUILD 93→94 (`index.html` L668, read this turn) + v94 CHANGELOG note prepended.
DEPLOY: commit `index.html` + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` + `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` → Netlify
(grant2223 pro repo → ffpprofessional.com); confirm avatar menu shows **Build 94**.
STILL OPEN (lower priority, unchanged): link Bank Details↔Stripe cards; one-off-payment gate (PRODUCT-INTENT decision — do
NOT flip without Grant's OK; code comment says the package-first gate is intentional); mis-tap adjacency (Mark-paid next to
View-send); impact counts in destructive modals; unify native confirm() → branded openModalShell; reschedule "from now on" scope.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · PRO CONFIRM MODALS (5 HIGH) done (PRO_BUILD 91→92) + ffp-provider DELETE = NOT SAFE YET
Added confirmation guards (native confirm(), impact-specific wording) to the 5 HIGH-priority destructive/money actions:
- `afRemove` (remove client's signed form) + `cancelMemberPlan` (cancel active package) — `ffp-professional-client-loader.js`.
- `saveBankDetails` (overwrite payout IBAN) + `shareInvoice` (send invoice w/ live pay-link) + `savePayment` (grant package
  credits — only on the credit-grant path) — `ffp-professional-billing-loader.js`.
Validated (isolated node --check OK; full-file check truncates = RULE 3). Pro `index.html` PRO_BUILD 91→92 (busts the loaders).
DEPLOY: commit those 3 pro files → Netlify; confirm avatar = Build 92.
✅ ffp-provider-* DELETION unblocked (2026-07-05). Repointed EVERY live redirect from `/ffp-provider-dashboard.html` →
`https://partner.findfitpeople.com/` (Stage-B partner portal): `login.html` L455 (destinations.provider), `ffp-admin-auth.js`
L65 (wrong-role bounce), `auth-handoff.html` L58-59 (safeNext defaults), backend `index.js` — PROVIDER_DASH_URL default (L2057)
now partner URL + the 2 hardcoded `redirect:'/ffp-provider-dashboard.html'` (L1621/4550) now `redirect: PROVIDER_DASH_URL`.
BACKEND_VERSION v160→v161. VERIFIED: zero LIVE ffp-provider- references remain in staying files — only 4 harmless COMMENTS
(ffp-claims-loader.js L19, ffp-time.js L6, ffp-admin-auth.js L3, login.html L128) + backend comment L364.
DEPLOY-MODEL CORRECTION (VERIFIED 2026-07-05 via GET https://ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/ → {"version":"v161"}):
the live backend ALREADY reports v161 — i.e. edits to `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js` in THIS workspace ARE
reaching production. Earlier session notes/claims that this is a "dead copy" / that the real backend is a separate un-synced
repo were WRONG and are retracted. The exact sync mechanism is unconfirmed, but the FACT is: this file == what's live. So the
backend provider-redirect fix (v161) IS ALREADY LIVE — no separate backend deploy step needed.
ORDER OF OPS for Grant: (1) the BACKEND (v161, provider redirects) is already live — done. (2) Deploy the 3 FRONTEND files
(login.html + ffp-admin-auth.js + auth-handoff.html) → Netlify (grant2223/ffp-passport). (3) THEN delete all `ffp-provider-*.js`
+ `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` from grant2223/ffp-passport. (auth-handoff.html is legacy partner cross-origin handoff — also a
deletion candidate once nothing links to it.)
NOTE TO SELF: stop asserting deploy state from memory — always GET / (backend) or read the device Build stamp (frontend) THIS
turn. Do not re-introduce the "dead copy / separate repo" claim; it's contradicted by the live v161.

## LATEST — 2026-07-05 · PRO CONFIRM MODALS batch 2 (MEDIUM) + archive-icon (PRO_BUILD 92→93)
Added confirm() guards to 4 more destructive actions + fixed 1 icon:
- `cnDelete` (delete coach note) + `afDeleteTemplate` (delete form template) — ffp-professional-client-loader.js.
- `signOut` (all entry points) + `clearProNotifs` (clear all notifications) — index.html.
- Archive-service button icon trash→`archive` (ffp-professional-services-loader.js L67). VERIFIED live: `pro_delete_service`
  is a SOFT archive (`update pro_services set status='archived'`), so the modal "kept" copy was correct — only the icon lied.
Now 9 confirm() guards total (5 HIGH build 92 + 4 MEDIUM). Validated (isolated node --check OK). PRO_BUILD 92→93.
DEPLOY: commit index.html + ffp-professional-client-loader.js + ffp-professional-services-loader.js → Netlify; avatar = Build 93.
STILL OPEN (lower priority, not done): saveSlotPeople / reschedule "from now on" wording (name who's affected); pure UX-flow
items (Pull-from-Passport button placement, link Bank Details↔Stripe cards, one-off-payment gate, mis-tap adjacency, impact
counts in modals); unify native confirm() → branded openModalShell.

## BACKLOG — PRO APP: CONFIRMATION MODALS + UX (audited 2026-07-04, TACKLE NEXT SESSION)
Reuse the existing `openModalShell('','Title?','<impact copy>','Cancel/Delete')` pattern (RULE 5) + add danger (red) styling.
CONFIRMATIONS TO ADD — HIGH:
- [ ] `afRemove` — remove a client's signed/assigned FORM (`ffp-professional-client-loader.js:286`) — compliance record, no guard. TOP.
- [ ] `shareInvoice` — SEND/share invoice w/ live Stripe pay-link (`ffp-professional-billing-loader.js:192`) — fires immediately.
- [ ] `cancelMemberPlan` — cancel a client's ACTIVE PAID package (`ffp-professional-client-loader.js:713`).
- [ ] `saveBankDetails` — overwrite payout bank/IBAN (`ffp-professional-billing-loader.js:150`) — misroutes real money.
- [ ] `savePayment`→`pro_assign_package` — silently grants package credits (`ffp-professional-billing-loader.js:277`).
CONFIRMATIONS — MEDIUM:
- [ ] `afDeleteTemplate` delete form template (`client-loader.js:335`); `cnDelete` delete coach note (`client-loader.js:232`).
- [ ] `saveSlotPeople` (`scheduling-loader.js:136`) + reschedule "from now on" (`:388`) — name who/what is affected in the copy.
- [ ] Sign out — no confirm at either entry (`index.html:414,442`; one styled `.danger`) → loses unsaved profile edits.
- [ ] `clearProNotifs` — permanent, no confirm/undo (`index.html:426`).
- [ ] Archive service — button uses TRASH icon but copy says "kept"; RPC named `pro_delete_service` (`services-loader.js:67,142`)
      → VERIFY live DB whether it's a soft archive or hard delete BEFORE trusting the copy.
UX / FLOW (second pass):
- [ ] Unify native `confirm()` (scheduling) vs branded modal (elsewhere) into one pattern.
- [ ] "Pull from FFP Passport" button sits ABOVE the email field it needs (`client-loader.js:465`).
- [ ] Link Bank Details + Stripe Connect cards (two unlinked "get paid" setups) (`billing-loader.js:34,133`).

## LATEST — 2026-07-04 · PRO GROWTH LOOP — clearer Passport message + "Invite a client" referral button (Pro PRO_BUILD 90→91; backend v158→v159; NO DB change)
Grant's two-thing ask toward the coach→client→member flywheel (coaches/facilities = the fastest member-acquisition channel):
1. **Clearer message on ffpprofessional.com** (`FFP Professional app/landing.html`): the Passport strip now reads
   "**Sign up, get your FFP Passport — it's your key to the dashboard**" and states the coach is a Passport member too (an
   active person who trains, gets discovered and earns). No separate pro signup/fee/commission.
2. **"Invite a client to FFP Passport" button** on the Pro app Clients panel (`ffp-professional-client-loader.js`,
   `renderMembersList`): copies the coach's referral link so a client who joins via `?ref=` is credited to the coach.
   - Backend **v159** (`index.js`): NEW `GET /api/pro/invite?email=<coachEmail>` → resolves the coach's `members` row,
     GENERATES + persists `referral_code` (via existing `genReferralCode`) if missing, returns
     `{code, url:'https://ffppassport.com/join?ref=CODE'}`. Reuses the existing referral-credit loop (onboard ?ref=).
   - Frontend gets the coach email from `supabase.auth.getUser()`, caches the link on `window._proInviteUrl`, copies via
     clipboard (+ textarea fallback), toasts. Pro `index.html` PRO_BUILD 90→91 (busts the client loader).
VERIFIED THIS TURN: client loader node --check OK; invite endpoint node --check OK (heredoc); backend ends `module.exports = app;`
(L6500), endpoint at L4713, BACKEND_VERSION='v159' (L551); PRO_BUILD='91'.
CONSTRAINT/NOTE: invite link points to the existing, proven `ffppassport.com/join?ref=` referral route (credits the coach).
Grant mentioned clients sign up on findfitpeople.com — if that page should be the target instead, it must accept `?ref=` and
run the same attribution; flag before switching the URL. This is the front-door + invite loop only; the full self-serve Pro
checkout on ffpprofessional.com (spec written this session) is NOT built yet.
DEPLOY: TWO repos. (a) Pro repo (ffpprofessional.com): `landing.html` + `index.html` + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js`
→ Netlify; confirm avatar shows Build 91. (b) Backend repo: `index.js` (v159) → Vercel; confirm `GET /` shows v159 and
`GET /api/pro/invite?email=<you>` returns a join URL.

## LATEST — 2026-07-04 · GARMIN-STYLE HR ZONES + editable Max HR marker + always-on zones share option (member FFP_BUILD 534→535; core ?v=311→312; NO DB/backend change)
Built the HR-zones work Grant approved. NO database or backend change — Max HR rides the existing `member_profile_meta_save`
jsonb patch (same path as Resting HR/HRV).
- **`assets/ffp-fitness-stats-core.js` (?v=312):** new `maxHR` marker in `prDefs` + `HEALTH` list (Bio Age tab, next to Resting
  HR/HRV; leaderboard button suppressed for it). `_prCol.maxHR='max_hr'`, `_prInt.maxHR=1`. New `getMaxHR()` method. New GLOBAL
  helpers `window.ffpMemberMaxHR()` (member's SET value, else 220 − age from FFPAuth DOB) + `window.ffpHrZones(maxHR)` →
  5 zones at % Max HR (Garmin default: 50-60-70-80-90-100%), each {z,name,lo,hi,color}.
- **`assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js`:** `PR_MAP.maxHR={col:'max_hr',...}`; when unset, DEFAULTS `records.maxHR` to
  {value:220−age, estimated:true} so the marker shows the estimate ("· est.") and is editable (saving clears the flag).
- **`ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 535):** (a) activity-card HR-zone rows now show each zone's bpm RANGE from
  `window.ffpHrZones()` (e.g. "Z3  140–153 bpm"); (b) Share Options ALWAYS lists "HR zones" — disabled with a hint when the
  activity has no zone data (was hidden entirely before). Zones still auto-show on the card when the activity has data.
CONSTRAINT (told Grant): zone TIMES still come from the recording device (WHOOP/manual) — Passport computes + displays the
Garmin-style bpm RANGES from Max HR, but can't re-bucket the minutes without the raw HR stream (needs a Garmin/Coros integration).

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · EDIT-FROM-CARD + PIN-LOCATION-MISMATCH fixes (member FFP_BUILD 533→534; awaiting Grant deploy) + HR-ZONES question open
Two bugs fixed (Build 534), one question pending:
1. **Edit activity didn't open straight to the modal** (path: Passport › My Activity › card › Edit activity). Cause: the
   Fitness Stats loader defines its OWN `window.ffpEditActivity` (assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js L1213) that OVERRIDES the
   dashboard's — and it left the full-screen card open + awaited an RPC before opening the editor (modal opened behind the
   card, delayed). Fix: the loader's version now CLOSES the card first (`ffpCloseActivityCard`) and reuses the card's already-
   full `window._ffpActCard` row (instant, no RPC) when invoked from a card; still RPC-fetches for thin list rows.
2. **Pin-the-location: saved place ≠ picked place.** Picking a search result (e.g. "Rose Park Hotel") recentred the map, whose
   `moveend`→`reverseCenter` reverse-geocoded the coords and OVERWROTE `cur` with a different nearby business ("InsuranceMarket
   …"). Fix (FFPLocPick, ffp-member-dashboard.html): added `pickLock` — set on a deliberate search-pick, checked at the top of
   `reverseCenter` to skip the recenter's auto-rename, cleared on the next real `dragstart` (so dragging still re-geocodes).
   The searched place is now what `use()` saves.
VERIFIED THIS TURN: picker <script> block (154 lines) node --check OK; loader `ffpEditActivity` node --check OK; loader ends
`})();` (L1870); dashboard ends `</html>` (L8778); FFP_BUILD='534' (L4434).
DEPLOY: commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + `assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js` (Build 534) → Netlify.
3. **HR ZONES (question, NOT yet coded):** Passport does NOT compute zone boundaries — it stores/shows minutes-per-zone
   (`metrics.hr_zones_ms` → zone_one_milli…zone_five_milli) that come from the connected WEARABLE (WHOOP) or manual entry; the
   bpm boundaries you see in Garmin are Garmin's own model. To "match Garmin" Passport needs the member's MAX HR (+ resting HR
   for the Karvonen/HRR method) and a chosen formula (% Max HR / % HR Reserve / % LTHR). NOTE the constraint: the zone TIMES are
   pre-bucketed by the recording device, so Passport can compute + DISPLAY Garmin-style bpm ranges/labels from max HR, but can't
   re-bucket the times without the raw HR stream (not stored). Asked Grant which method + max-HR source before building.

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · FITNESS STATS · PANEL-OPEN SPEED, structural (member FFP_BUILD 532→533; awaiting Grant deploy)
Follows Build 532 (thumbnail optimization). Grant approved the deeper fix. The panel used to
`await Promise.all([_profP, _logsP, _dailyP])` (loader L~1735) BEFORE its first paint — so it blocked on the slowest of:
profile-meta RPC, a **redundant** `/activity-logs` re-fetch (the dashboard's loadJourneyLogs already loaded those rows), and
a **wearables/daily** POST to an EXTERNAL API (WHOOP) — the real >1s culprit for connected members. Fix (Build 533):
- **`ffp-member-dashboard.html`**: expose `window.LOGS = LOGS;` right after `const LOGS = []` (L2424). LOGS is mutated in
  place (`LOGS.length=0` + push), never reassigned, so the single reference stays live for lazy panels.
- **`assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js`**: (a) SEED `activityCache` from `window.LOGS` — OWN logs only (`!l.partner`, so the
  seed set == the /activity-logs fetch set → no flash) → Recent Activity shows INSTANTLY; (b) PAINT after only the fast
  `_profP` RPC; (c) `_logsP` (authoritative re-fetch) + `_dailyP` (wearables) now refresh their own sections via `.then`
  (`_fsRender`) instead of blocking the first paint — the WHOOP recovery/strain card + HRV/RestingHR fold in when the
  external call returns. WHOOP render block kept verbatim, just moved behind `await _dailyP` after the paint.
VERIFIED THIS TURN: full `loadFromSupabase` (178 lines) node --check OK (no truncation); loader ends `})();`; dashboard ends
`</body></html>` (L8762-63); FFP_BUILD='533' (L4434).

fills a moment later without holding up the open).

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · FITNESS STATS · RECENT ACTIVITY load speed (member FFP_BUILD 531→532; awaiting Grant deploy)
Grant: Passport › Fitness Stats › Recent Activity loads >1s (unacceptable). Root cause (read the loader): the recent-list
row thumbnails (`_activityRow`, assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js L~1120) drew the **full-size original photo** into a fixed
46px box (`background-image:url(raw photo_url)`) — multi-MB per image × up to 10 rows. FIX: route the thumb through the image
optimizer — `window.ffpImg(l.photo_url, 96)` → a resized WebP (optimizer floors at 640 so it only downscales, never blurs) +
the existing service-worker photo cache makes repeat opens instant. No-op for non-Supabase URLs. Loader is cache-busted by
FFP_BUILD, so the dashboard build bump ships it.
ALSO DIAGNOSED (not yet changed — flagged): the panel does `await Promise.all([_profP, _logsP, _dailyP])` (L1735) before it
paints — blocking the first render on the slowest of profile-meta + a REDUNDANT activity-logs fetch (the dashboard's
loadJourneyLogs already loaded the same rows into window.LOGS) + a wearables/daily POST (external API). Decoupling the
wearables call and/or seeding activityCache from window.LOGS would speed the initial panel open further — offered to Grant.
VERIFIED THIS TURN: `_activityRow` thumb snippet node --check OK (heredoc); FFP_BUILD='532'.
DEPLOY: Grant commits `assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 532) → Netlify. Confirm avatar

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · SHARE CARD "Use my photo as background" FIX (member FFP_BUILD 530→531; awaiting Grant deploy)
Grant: with the "Use my photo as background" toggle ON, the photo didn't show (card fell back to the gradient). Root cause
(verified by reading the share code + confirming `has_photo_url=true` for all shared rows, so NOT missing data): **CORS-cache
taint.** `ffpRenderActivityCard` draws the same photo as a plain background first (L7117) → browser caches it WITHOUT CORS
headers → the later share export requests it `crossOrigin='anonymous'`, gets served that cached non-CORS copy → canvas TAINTED
→ `toDataURL()` throws → photo silently dropped to gradient. (The logo never hit this — it isn't pre-drawn as a background.)
FIX (member dashboard, Build 531):
- `_ffpImgToDataUrl` (L7322) rewritten: **fetch → blob → FileReader dataURL** (a blob dataURL never taints the canvas);
  `cache:'reload'` forces a fresh CORS response past the poisoned cache. Old crossOrigin-Image→canvas path kept as fallback
  (with a `_ffpc=1` param to dodge the cache entry). 8s timeout.
- `_ffpMakeCardCanvas` (L7346) + `hasPhoto` (L7507): background source and toggle visibility now fall back to `photos[0]`
  when `photo_url` is empty (multi-photo logs).
VERIFIED THIS TURN: `_ffpImgToDataUrl` node --check OK (heredoc); dashboard ends `</body></html>` (L8746-47); FFP_BUILD='531' (L4418).
DEPLOY: Grant commits `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 531) → Netlify. Confirm avatar = Build 531, open an activity → Share →
toggle "Use my photo as background" ON → the photo now fills the card background (no gradient).

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · LOCATION: card label + edit-path fix + DATA BACKFILL DONE (member FFP_BUILD 528→530; DB backfilled LIVE)
Follows the v158/528 location-source work below. v158 is DEPLOYED (backend `GET /` = v158; `/api/places/reverse?lat=25.1226&lng=55.2157`
returns city:"Dubai" — Google Geocoding API confirmed enabled). Three things done this turn:
1. **Build 529 — EDIT-PATH COORDINATE FIX.** `openLogModalForEdit` (member dashboard L~6327) restored the pin only from
   `row.checkin_lat/lng`, but rows from the activity list (LOGS) + the card remap coords to `lat/lng` → editing dropped
   coords → save wiped them. Now reads BOTH (`checkin_lat ?? lat`), matching the card's own tolerance (L7087).
2. **Build 530 — LOCATION LABEL = WHAT THE MEMBER PICKS** (Grant: "input SALT, Kite Beach → card says SALT, Kite Beach").
   (a) Card (`ffpRenderActivityCard` L7101): was `[venue,city,country].join(', ')` → now shows `venue` VERBATIM, city/country
   only as fallback. (b) Capture (`pick` in FFPLocPick): stores name + landmark = place name + the leading token of Google's
   formatted address when it's a real place (else neighbourhood/area). Verified: SALT (address "Kite Beach, Street - 2C St -
   Umm Suqeim…") → **"SALT, Kite Beach"**; street-first addresses fall back to the area (e.g. "CrossFit Alioth, Al Quoz").
3. **DATA BACKFILL — DONE, LIVE.** Re-geocoded every messy coordinate group in `activity_logs` through the live
   `/api/places/reverse` and corrected `city`/`country` ONLY (venue names preserved). Fixed **28 coord'd rows** (22 Dubai —
   incl. a row whose Dubai pin was mislabeled "London"/UK; 4 Abu Dhabi from Al Hidayriyyat/Al Bateen; 2 Ras Al-Khaimah from
   "Rams") + **1 city-only** "Jumeirah Lakes Towers"→Dubai, + blanket `country='United Arab Emirates (the)'`→'United Arab Emirates'.
   Verified after: NO coord'd row still shows a suburb/district as its city. (Suburbs like Al Quoz/Al Barsha/JLT no longer
   fragment the world map — they collapse into Dubai.)
VERIFIED THIS TURN: label logic node-tested (→"SALT, Kite Beach"); dashboard ends `</body></html>` (L8720-21); FFP_BUILD='530'
(L4411). Backfill row counts came back 22/4/2 from the UPDATE…RETURNING.
DEPLOY: Grant commits `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 530) → Netlify. (Backend v158 already live; DB backfill already applied.)
Confirm avatar menu = Build 530, then: log an activity picking "SALT" → card reads "SALT, Kite Beach"; edit an activity → its
pin/coords survive the save; world map groups Dubai suburbs under Dubai.
REMAINING (optional, flagged): coverage — 60% of logs still have no coords (make the pin/GPS more prominent); nothing else outstanding.

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · LOCATION ACCURACY — all capture paths → GOOGLE (member FFP_BUILD 527→528; backend v157→v158; DEPLOYED)
PROBLEM (Grant): world-map accuracy still off + "the location in Log Activity should match the activity card." Traced the
full location data flow (Explore) + queried live `activity_logs` (208 rows): the data model is already ONE field set — form
saves `venue` + `checkin_lat/lng` + `city/country`; BOTH the card (`member_activity_view`) and the map (`/activity-logs`→LOGS)
read those SAME columns. So rendering was fine; the STORED data was messy. Real causes, from the data:
- Only **83/208 (40%)** rows have coordinates; 60% are city-only (no exact pin).
- The map picker had THREE geocoders: typed search = **Google Places** (clean: "CrossFit Alioth", true city), but **drag-pin =
  OpenStreetMap/Nominatim** and **GPS + city-fallback = BigDataCloud**. Nominatim returned STREET names as venue and accepted a
  **suburb as the city** (`a.suburb` → "Al Quoz Industrial 3", "Jumeirah Lakes Towers") — so the map clustered by suburb, splintering
  Dubai into scattered district dots. That's the visible "inaccuracy," and why the card's "venue, city" looked wrong.
FIX (world-class, single source = Google):
- **Backend `index.js` v157→v158** (L551): NEW `GET /api/places/reverse?lat&lng` — Google **classic Geocoding API**
  (`maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json`) with the SAME `GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY` used by Places + the Timezone endpoint.
  Returns the same `{name, maps_url, components:{country,country_code,region,city,area}}` shape as `/api/places/details`
  (scans all results, prefers locality/postal_town for city, POI/premise for name). Inserted right after `/api/places/details`.
- **Member `ffp-member-dashboard.html` Build 528** (FFP_BUILD L4402): FFPLocPick `reverseCenter()` (drag + one-tap GPS, since
  GPS calls schedReverse→reverseCenter) now calls `/api/places/reverse` instead of Nominatim (stale-guarded vs rapid re-drags,
  captures city/country/region/area/country_code); the `use()` city fallback now calls `/api/places/reverse` instead of
  BigDataCloud. Result: all 3 paths (search/drag/GPS) resolve through Google → clean venue + TRUE city everywhere; the map
  clusters by real cities and Log-Activity location == activity-card location, going forward.
VERIFIED THIS TURN: backend reverse endpoint node --check OK (heredoc); frontend reverseCenter + use()-fallback snippets
node --check OK (heredoc); no `nominatim`/`bigdatacloud` remain in the picker; backend ends `module.exports = app;` (L6479);
dashboard ends `</body></html>` (L8696-97). (Bash `tail`/`sed` on the mounted big files TRUNCATE — RULE 3 — so end-of-file
+ syntax were verified via Grep + isolated heredocs, not full-file parse.)
INCOMPLETE / NEXT:
- **Grant must confirm the Google Cloud project has the *Geocoding API* enabled** for `GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY` (Timezone API on the
  same key already works, so it's very likely on). Post-deploy smoke test: `GET https://ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/api/places/reverse?lat=25.1226&lng=55.2157`
  should return `components.city:"Dubai"` (NOT "Al Quoz Industrial 3"). If it returns `REQUEST_DENIED`, enable Geocoding API.
- **Backfill** of the existing 83 coord'd rows (re-geocode → fix suburb-as-city) NOT done — offered, awaiting Grant.
- **Coverage** (60% have no coords) — separate lever (make the pin/GPS more prominent), not done.
- **Edit-path coordinate loss** (dashboard L~6458 restores venue but not lat/lng on edit → saving an edit wipes coords) — FOUND,
  NOT yet fixed (flagged to Grant).
DEPLOY: Grant commits `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js` (v158) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 528) →
Vercel (backend) + Netlify (frontend). Confirm avatar menu shows Build 528 and `GET /` backend shows v158.

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · CONNECTIONS PHOTOS BUG FIX (Build 527) + optimizer gradient fix
BUG (Grant, live): tapping an individual person in Community left their activity photos BLANK — never loaded, even after
10s. Cause: the person-view render (`assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` ~L259 `gridTile(a,false)`) emitted `data-lazybg`
tiles but never called the lazy loader (only the ALL feed did). FIX: robust `cfLazy(host)` — uses `window.ffpLazyBg` when
present (scroll-lazy) else loads images IMMEDIATELY (fallback, so photos ALWAYS show even if the dashboard export isn't
deployed); called in BOTH the person view AND the ALL feed. Loader ?v 337→338. ALSO fixed a latent optimizer bug:
`assets/ffp-img.js` `fixBg` now swaps only the image `url()` and KEEPS gradient/overlay layers (was replacing whole
`linear-gradient(),url()` backgrounds with just the image → quest covers lost their overlay). ffp-img.js ?v 523→527.
FFP_BUILD 526→527. cfLazy validated (parses); files reliable per Read (node --check truncates at the mount). NOTE on
meet-ups/quests "slow": those short cover lists are all-visible so lazy won't help — the >2s is the CDN cold-transform
generating each resized cover the FIRST time it's requested, then cached/instant. Real fix = warm-on-upload (pre-request
the resized cover after upload) — NOT yet built; flagged as next.
COMMIT: `ffp-member-dashboard.html`, `ffp-passport-landing.html`, `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js`, `assets/ffp-img.js`.

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · STREAK FIX — `member_activity_streak` strict + local-tz (LIVE DB migration, no deploy)
Coach Grant showed 32; Passport panel + Fitness Stats showed 31. Cause = two rules: the RPC had a deliberate make-up
"streak save" (forgive one missed day if you had a 2+ activity day) AND counted in UTC; the dashboard is strict-consecutive
in local time. Grant chose STRICT. Migration `member_activity_streak_strict_local_tz` rewrote the RPC: strict consecutive
(removed has_extra/save_used), counts in the MEMBER's timezone (members.timezone, default Asia/Dubai) not UTC, today-grace
kept. Verified LIVE: grant 32→31, sunjay 25→24. Coach card/strap/email read this RPC live via /api/coach/snapshot → now
31 automatically; dashboard already showed 31 → all surfaces agree. Follow-up (optional): point the dashboard's own
client-side streak at the RPC so there's literally ONE source.

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · IMAGE OPTIMIZER v2 — DOWNSCALE-ONLY (member FFP_BUILD 522→523; awaiting Grant deploy)
The 521 optimizer broke display by UNDERSIZING (requested widths smaller than the display → CDN returned low-res →
CSS `cover` upscaled them → looked cropped/blurry). FIX in `assets/ffp-img.js`: a HARD 640px floor — `width = bucket(max(640,
cssW*DPR))` — so it can ONLY down-scale the stored original, never below the display size; the picture can't get worse,
only the FILE shrinks (WebP q72, width-only = never crops). Non-Supabase (`assets/` Netlify) URLs untouched; idempotent.
Unit-tested (130px tile→640, 430px→1080, assets/→null, already-render→null); module valid (120 lines, ends `})();`).
Re-added the `<script>` include to `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (`<head>`, FFP_BUILD 522→**523**) + `ffp-passport-landing.html`
(+ storage preconnect). **CANNOT self-verify the live render here** (no dashboard render env; show_widget CSP blocks the
storage host) — so on deploy: confirm Build 523, eyeball the Passport grid + covers; if anything's off the include is one
line to pull. Off-switch = delete the `<script src="assets/ffp-img.js">` line.
- **Build 524 (2026-07-03) — PASSPORT LOAD SPEED, 2 more levers (verified parse):** (a) activity-grid tiles LAZY-LOAD their
  photo — `myActivityTile` emits `data-lazybg` (no inline background-image), `ffpLazyBg()` sets it via an
  IntersectionObserver (300px pre-margin) through `ffpImg()` as each tile nears the viewport; `renderMyGrid` calls it. So a
  long feed fires image requests on scroll, not all at once. (b) default `state.timeRange` 'all'→'7d' (active chip moved to
  "7 days"). The range is GLOBAL (grid + map + stats), so the whole Passport now defaults to a WEEK view — trade-off:
  returning/less-active members see less by default; revert = `timeRange:'all'` + active chip. FFP_BUILD 523→524.
- **Build 525 (2026-07-03) — 3 more photo levers (all validated):** (a) `sw.js` v3 = SERVICE-WORKER PHOTO CACHE:
  cache-first for `kxzyuofecmtymablnmak.supabase.co/storage/v1/*` in a new capped ('ffp-img-v1', ~260, kept across
  deploys) cache → repeat scrolls / re-opens / profile revisits load instantly from device, no network (safe: URLs are
  content-versioned; opaque cross-origin responses are cacheable). (b) storage-host `preconnect` added to the dashboard
  `<head>`. (c) `assets/ffp-image-upload.js` cacheControl 3600→31536000 (1yr) on new uploads. FFP_BUILD 524→525; sw.js
  header→v3. FILES to commit: `sw.js`, `ffp-member-dashboard.html`, `assets/ffp-image-upload.js`.
- **Build 526 (2026-07-03) — connections feed lazy-load:** `ffpLazyBg` now `window.ffpLazyBg`; connections "Latest
  activity" grid (`assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` gridTile→data-lazybg, renderGlobalGrid calls it) lazy-loads its
  up-to-60 photos on scroll. Loader ?v 336→337. FFP_BUILD 525→526. Commit: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js`.
- **REPO CLEANUP (delete list, verified by audit 2026-07-03):** SAFE TO DELETE — 2 committed SECRETS (rotate them):
  `VAPID-KEYS-ADD-TO-VERCEL-THEN-DELETE.txt`, `AuthKey_A376D39TSC.p8`; the nested backend copy `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/`
  (backend has its own repo/deploy; 0 frontend refs); 9 unused images (`assets/default-passport-photo.jpg, experiences.jpg,

## [prior] IMAGE OPTIMIZER REVERTED (Build 521→522) — 521 broke image display
The Build 521 global optimizer below shipped and DEGRADED how images rendered across the platform (undersized /
mis-cropped). REVERTED same session: removed the `<script src="assets/ffp-img.js">` include from `ffp-member-dashboard.html`
(+ from `ffp-passport-landing.html`), bumped FFP_BUILD 521→522, header top-line 522. `assets/ffp-img.js` stays on disk
but UNREFERENCED — nothing loads it. Images now render exactly as at Build 520. **Grant to commit the reverted
dashboard + landing → confirm avatar menu shows Build 522 → images correct again.** LESSON (permanent): no blanket
"touch every image" change; any image-perf work must be per-surface and PROVEN in an on-device render BEFORE shipping.

## LATEST — 2026-07-03 · [SUPERSEDED / REVERTED] IMAGE PERFORMANCE — resize-CDN optimizer (member FFP_BUILD 520→521)
Photos were served RAW from Supabase `/object/public/` everywhere — the Passport grid downloaded full ~350KB
originals to fill ~100px tiles; `site-images` (landing hero + app screenshots) averaged 3.6MB (largest 14MB). The
Supabase image-transform CDN was unused (verified enabled — `/render/image/public/…` responds).
- **NEW `assets/ffp-img.js`** (114 lines, standalone, self-installing — NOT inline in the 13.7k-line dashboard).
  Rewrites every public-storage photo URL → `/storage/v1/render/image/public/<bucket>/<path>?width=W&quality=70`,
  W snapped to buckets and sized to each element (×DPR capped 2). Handles BOTH `<img src>` and inline
  `background-image`, via an initial sweep + a SCOPED MutationObserver (processes only newly-added nodes, rAF-batched)
  + a couple of delayed sweeps for panels that reveal after first paint. Adds `loading=lazy`/`decoding=async` to imgs.
  Idempotent; only touches THIS project's storage host; leaves `assets/` (Netlify) + data URIs untouched. Also exposes
  `window.ffpImg(url,w)`.
- **Wired via one `<script>` include** (no render-code edits): `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (`<head>`, first; FFP_BUILD
  521, header top-line 521) and `ffp-passport-landing.html` (`<head>` + a `preconnect` to the storage host).
- **Effect:** Passport grids/feeds pull ~15-30KB thumbnails instead of full originals (~90% cut); landing screenshot
  gallery (site-images) served resized. Full-res only when a photo is opened. **INCOMPLETE:** Grant to commit
  `assets/ffp-img.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + `ffp-passport-landing.html`; confirm avatar-menu shows Build 521,
  then check a photo URL in devtools Network shows `/render/image/…&width=`. FOLLOW-UPS (my rec #6-8): feed pagination,
  service-worker thumbnail cache, re-export the biggest `site-images` PNGs as WebP.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · COACH EMAIL REDESIGN (v157) + TIMEZONE BACKFILL + deploy pipeline root-caused
- **Deploy pipeline (the whole night's pain):** backend commits WERE in GitHub (repo `grant2223/ffp-passport-backend`
  main, v152→v156 all committed) but Vercel hadn't deployed — live server kept serving the pre-v154 build (old "quick
  nudge" email). Confirmed live via GitHub API (not cached raw). It finally deployed v156 (~20:11 UTC); `GET /` now
  returns `{"version":"v156"}` and the version stamp makes this verifiable forever. LESSON: verify deploy via the
  version endpoint, never assume a commit == live.
- **Coach email REDESIGN → v157 (Grant sign-off on a render).** `renderCoachReminderEmail` rebuilt: hero is a NUDGE
  title ("Haven't moved today, {name}?") + stake sub; the coach's WORDS moved OUT of the title into their own signed
  "From Coach Grant" bordered section. REMOVED the "G" avatar chip and the streak pill (Grant hated both). Copy always
  drives the ONE action = log today; the onboard invite no longer hijacks the reminder. Week chart / 5 pillars / July
  race unchanged. Rendered with Grant's real data (32-day streak, rank 1, 573 min). File: `assets/.../index.js` v157,
  BACKEND_VERSION L546, `module.exports=app;` L6404 (verified). **INCOMPLETE:** (a) Grant must commit index.js → confirm
  `GET /`=`v157` → THEN send; (b) "needs more visuals" — follow-up polish requested.
- **Timezone: reminder fires at each member's LOCAL 5pm — mechanism was correct, DATA was not.** All 18 active members
  were stored `Asia/Dubai`. Backfilled the 3 genuinely elsewhere from city/country: sunjay→Europe/London,
  bazzgoes(Cairns)→Australia/Brisbane, johnnytwocombs(Sydney)→Australia/Sydney (AbuDhabi/Sharjah correctly stay Dubai).
  Proof (Intl): Dubai 5pm=13:00 UTC, London=16:00 UTC, Brisbane/Sydney=07:00 UTC — distinct, so hourly cron's
  `lp.hour===17` gate sends each at their own 5pm. Browser tz auto-overwrites on next app open (coach loader → /api/member/timezone).
- **Timezone FOR ANYONE WHO JOINS (v157 code):** new `tzFromLatLng(lat,lng)` (Google Time Zone API, reuses `GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY`)
  — `/api/onboard/from-stripe` now sets `timezone` DEFAULT from the coordinates of the city the member picks (both INSERT
  + UPDATE paths, `timezone: derivedTz || undefined`). Device tz overwrites on first open. Graceful (null → keep default).
  **REQUIRES** Google "Time Zone API" enabled on the Places Cloud project; if off, silently falls back to device-on-open.
  So new members get their true local-5pm reminder with zero manual mapping. helper L801, derivation L877, fields L901/L942.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · COACH-CARD BLANK ROOT-CAUSE + VERIFIABLE BACKEND VERSION + onboarding re-engagement (backend v155→v156; awaiting Grant deploy)
Grant: "Coach Grant still doesn't show after 10+ attempts." Diagnosed by CHECKING (not guessing), this turn:
- Loader IS deployed at `assets/ffp-coach-loader.js` (web_fetch of raw GitHub = 200, snapshot version, self-boots) — NOT missing.
- DB columns `coach_onboarded_at, motivations, goals, timezone` all EXIST on `members` (live query) — snapshot not throwing on schema.
- **ROOT CAUSE:** the *deployed* loader BLANKS the card (`m2.innerHTML=''`) on any snapshot error. My LOCAL loader already has
  a never-blank `renderBasic` fallback (L106-123, `if(!j||j.error||!j.snapshot) return renderBasic`) — but it was **never committed**.
  So if the live backend isn't returning clean snapshot JSON (stale/older deploy), the live loader → blank → no card.
- **Couldn't verify the live backend version** (GET `/` returned no version). FIXED: `const BACKEND_VERSION='v156'` (index.js L541),
  `GET /` now returns `{status,version}` (L1413). After deploy, `https://ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/` must show `"version":"v156"`.
- **Onboarding re-engagement (Grant's ask):** onboarding was ONLY in-app + passive (card shows intro when `coach_onboarded_at` null).
  Added: `activeLifeHook` now LEADS with the "Set my goals" onboard invite when `onboarded===false`, so BOTH the coach card AND the
  5pm reminder pull EXISTING un-onboarded members into onboarding — not just brand-new sign-ups.
- **Header cleanup:** removed the old `v374…v369` changelog block from `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (one Build number only, per Grant).
- **FILES for Grant to COMMIT (all three):** (1) `assets/ffp-coach-loader.js` (never-blank), (2) backend `index.js` (v156),
  (3) `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 520 — has the `#ffp-coach-mount` + loader `?v=521`). VERIFY: backend root shows v156; then
  open Passport → Coach Grant card renders (rich if snapshot OK, basic fallback if not — never blank).
  INCOMPLETE until Grant commits + confirms on device.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · ACTIVE-LIFE COACH SYSTEM COMPLETE (backend v151→v155 + member FFP_BUILD 518; awaiting Grant deploy of v155)
Full build (Grant "build it together"): the snapshot brain now feeds ALL surfaces, all in Coach Grant's voice.
- **Snapshot** `computeActiveLifeSnapshot` (v153): weekly minutes/day by pillar, 5-pillar breadth, streak, live July-race
  standing, connections + nearby meet-ups, goals+motivations. `activeLifeHook` picks ONE angle. VERIFIED live (Sunjay: 25-day
  streak, sports+fitness, ~40% activities free-text → keyword fallback carries them; London = 0 meet-ups → graceful).
- **Grow-the-community hook** (v154, Grant): sparse area / few connections → invite a friend / host a meet-up / share (not a
  flat nudge). Busy area → join-a-meet-up / streak / race.
- **Rich 5pm email** `renderCoachReminderEmail` (v154): email-safe (table + div-bars) render — Coach Grant identity chip,
  streak hero, minutes chart coloured by pillar, 5-pillar breadth, live race row, smart CTA. Wired into the cron.
- **Coach Grant attribution** (Grant: "these come from Coach Grant ONLY"): email hero has the Coach Grant chip; push title =
  "Coach Grant", body = the message; email SUBJECT = "A note from Coach Grant" (NOT the coaching line).
- **Rich in-app CARD** (v155, ffp-coach-loader ?v=519): renders from /api/coach/snapshot — Coach Grant header, streak, hook
  headline+line, 5-pillar strip, race, smart CTA + Talk-to-Coach. Polls every 5 min.
- **Onboarding** (v155): first sign-up (coach_onboarded_at null) → Coach Grant intro + motivations quick-pick grid (FFP_MOTIVATIONS)
  + one goal → POST /api/coach/onboard saves members.motivations/goals + coach_onboarded_at. Chat opener now uses the hook.
COMMIT: backend index.js (v155), vercel.json (cron consolidation), assets/ffp-coach-loader.js, ffp-member-dashboard.html
(FFP_BUILD 518, coach ?v=519), FFP-MASTER.md. DB migrations already live. TEST after deploy: /api/cron/daily-activity-reminder?dry=1
(preview hooks), ?only=<email>&force=1 (send yourself). NOTE loader node --check falsely truncates at L135 via the mount (RULE 3) — file is 210 lines, ends })();.

## ANTI-DOUBLING — ONE daily Coach Grant push (2026-07-02)
Triple-check found THREE daily member pushes could stack: coach-nudges (03:00 UTC), streak-nudge (14:00 UTC), and the new
daily-activity-reminder (local 5pm). All three = "you haven't logged / keep moving" style Coach Grant pushes → spam. FIX:
removed **coach-nudges** + **streak-nudge** from vercel.json crons — the 5pm daily-activity-reminder is now the SINGLE daily
proactive Coach Grant touchpoint (push + email, local time, and about to become snapshot-rich: streak/pillars/race). Their
ENDPOINT CODE stays (unscheduled, harmless) and can be deleted later. CRITICAL: the streak REWARDS ($20@14 / $50@30) are a DB
TRIGGER (activity_streak_reward), NOT the cron — so removing streak-nudge does NOT affect payouts. coach-profiles cron kept
(nightly profile warm, no push). Non-push crons untouched (sunday-summary, meetup-reminders, monthly-wrapup, lifecycle).

## FFP ACTIVE-LIFESTYLE COACHING BRAIN — canonical knowledge base (Grant 2026-07-02; commit to memory)
This is the SHARED mindset behind Coach Grant AND the pro/partner AI agents. Coded once as `FFP_ETHOS` in backend index.js
(~L1109) + injected into coach card-line, coach summary, coach chat, and the agent system prompt. Edit the const, not copies.
- **FFP is an ACTIVE-LIFESTYLE community, NOT a gym app.** Five pillars (source of truth = taxonomy_items list_key='category';
  activities map via list_key='activity'.parent): **FITNESS** (gym, strength, HIIT, CrossFit, martial arts), **SPORTS**
  (running, cycling, swimming, padel, tennis, football, racket+team), **WELLNESS** (yoga, pilates, mobility, meditation,
  breathwork), **ADVENTURE** (hiking, climbing, surfing, kayak, outdoors, travel), **RECOVERY** (sauna, ice bath, massage,
  rest). Movement is also SOCIAL (meet-ups, friends, events, experiences) and holistic (sleep, food, headspace, family).
- **Coaching mindset:** motivate, never report-card. Celebrate consistency + VARIETY across pillars. Lead with what matters
  most to THIS person now (streak to protect / dropping week / missing pillar / winnable quest-race spot / nearby adventure).
  Name the benefit → ONE easy next step that moves several goals at once. Always tie to their WHY.
- **Their WHY = motivations + goals** (why they joined). Motivations catalog `FFP_MOTIVATIONS` (12: get_fit, lose_weight,
  get_strong, mobility, meet_people, new_experiences, travel_adventure, destress, family_time, feel_good, better_lifestyle,
  compete). Stored on members.motivations (jsonb) + members.goals (jsonb) — captured in Coach Grant onboarding.
- **Voice:** warm, punchy, minimal words (active people hate waffle). Never shaming/clinical. streak≥3 or logged_today → celebrate,
  never "slipping". Not a doctor (injury→pro). No emojis unless they use them.
- **Surfaces the brain drives:** in-app coach card, 5pm daily email + push, Talk-to-Coach chat, new-member ONBOARDING (chat +
  quick-pick motivations + set 1-3 goals; members.coach_onboarded_at gates it). All read the member's real week vs their goals.
- **DB (migration member_motivations_goals_coach_onboarding, LIVE):** members.motivations jsonb, members.goals jsonb,
  members.coach_onboarded_at timestamptz. Personalisation snapshot (weekly minutes/pillars, streak, race, goal-progress,
  nearby experience) = `computeActiveLifeSnapshot` — TO BUILD (task #81). Rich v5 active-life EMAIL design approved (hero+streak,
  minutes chart coloured by pillar, "3 of 4 pillars", reasoned insight naming the missing pillar + a real nearby meet-up/experience,
  July-race standings, 2 CTAs) — TO BUILD into email/card/push (tasks #83/#84).

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · COACH 5-MIN REFRESH + one-row CTAs + 5PM "not logged" REMINDER (backend v150→v151; awaiting deploy)
1. **Coach refresh 3h→5min** (Grant: keep Coach Grant current all day). backend /api/coach/profile TTL now 5*60*1000.
   assets/ffp-coach-loader.js: added 5-min polling (setInterval) + refresh on visibilitychange; pauses while chat open.
2. **Coach CTA buttons on ONE ROW** — chip() now flex:1 equal-width, centred, label truncates; container flex-wrap:nowrap;
   labels shortened (Log activity / Meet-ups / Coach; Light session; Log). Loader cache-bust ffp-coach-loader.js ?v=513→518.
3. **NEW 5pm daily reminder** — GET /api/cron/daily-activity-reminder (HOURLY cron added to vercel.json). At 17:00 in EACH
   member's local timezone, if they have NOT logged an activity that local day, Coach Grant sends PUSH + EMAIL ("Hey [First]
   — checking in to make sure you get your daily activity in"), once per local day, honours preferences.no_coach_nudges.
   DB migration `members_timezone_and_daily_reminder_flag` APPLIED LIVE: members.timezone (default 'Asia/Dubai') +
   members.last_daily_reminder_on (date). Email reuses ffpLifecycleEmail shell, FFP Passport sender. Test: ?dry=1 / ?only=<id|email> / ?force=1 (ignore the 17:00 gate).
DEPLOY: backend v151 + vercel.json (Vercel picks up the new cron on deploy) + ffp-coach-loader.js + ffp-member-dashboard.html
(FFP_BUILD 517, coach ?v=518). NOTE: members default to Asia/Dubai tz — set members.timezone per-member for non-UAE to hit their true 5pm.
COST NOTE: 5-min coach refresh recomputes the AI line at most every 5 min per active viewer (small base, Haiku — negligible).

## STATUS CORRECTION — 2026-07-02 · JULY QUEST IS LIVE (verified via live DB, not notes)
The "July Activity Quest" (id aa292a57-da3b-467d-97e3-55f800a4fd11) is **live** — points_race, join_mode=auto, window
2026-06-29 20:00 → 2026-07-31 19:59 UTC. Already scoring REAL members: 7 members with points / 46 actions in the window.
So it is AUTHORED + PUBLISHED + RUNNING — nothing to build. Only open quest item = held earn-methods (partner check-in,
bring a guest) = blocked, no live partners. Task #6 marked complete. (Don't describe July quest as "to author" — it's done.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · PASSPORT "Connections" → "Community" (member FFP_BUILD 516→517; awaiting deploy)
Grant: rename + icon swap + strap copy. ffp-member-dashboard.html: nav (L1389) label "Connections"→"Community" and the
icon SWAPPED with Meetups per Grant (Community now `groups`=3-person, Meetups now `group`=2-person); panel-meet h2 (L646)
"Connections"→"Community". assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js (L136): strap sub "Search Find Fit People members by name"
→ "Search FFP Passport members by name". Cache-bust: FFP_BUILD 516→517, connections-feed-loader ?v=335→336. (Hero stat
label "Connections" count left as-is — it's the count, not the panel title.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · COACH GRANT FRESHNESS (backend v149→v150; awaiting Vercel deploy)
Grant: "Coach Grant on the Passport panel has had the same text all day — it should update to stay fresh." ROOT CAUSE:
/api/coach/profile cached coach_line for 24h and only recomputed if the member logged a new activity → frozen on any
no-log day. FIX (index.js v150): (1) refresh window 24h→3h (L5259) so it updates ~through the day, serving cache within
the window (fast) and recomputing when >3h old or trained-since. (2) computeCoachProfile adds facts.part_of_day +
local_hour (Dubai UTC+4) so the line is time-of-day aware. (3) coach_line AI prompt now opens time-appropriately + is
told to VARY the angle each regen (streak / meet-up / recovery / friend / favourite), temperature 1. (4) coachLineFallback
rewritten time-aware + rotates by the hour. Net: the card reads morning/afternoon/evening and changes through the day.
DEPLOY: backend v150 on Vercel. (Optional later: a few-hourly cron to pre-warm all profiles so even the first open is fresh.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · BRAND-MARK POLICY + FULL COMMIT CHECKLIST (end of day)
### BRAND MARK POLICY (Grant, commit to memory): FFP PASSPORT = the EMBLEM (medallion ffp-emblem.png / navy icon).
### PROFESSIONAL + PARTNER + BOOKING = the FFP ORBIT LOGO (ffp-logo.png / ffp-pro-*.png which is the orbit + PROFESSIONAL).
Audit 2026-07-02: Passport uses the emblem throughout (login/index/welcome/about/member splash + navy PWA icons) ✓.
Partner login.html + signup.html use the FFP orbit logo ✓. Pro app ICONS (ffp-pro-192/512) are the FFP orbit logo ✓.
FIXED the one leak: Pro app sidebar (FFP Professional app/index.html L410) was showing the PASSPORT EMBLEM → swapped to
/assets/icons/ffp-pro-192.png (the FFP orbit mark). OPEN (minor, left as-is): ffp-member-dashboard.html L7257 references
site-images/ffp-logo-white.png (orbit) in one spot — likely a specific element; review if strict emblem-only is wanted.
EMAIL: Grant is NOT doing the BIMI/VMC paid Gmail avatar at this stage — parked.

### COMMIT CHECKLIST — 2026-07-02 (Grant commits; nothing is live until committed)
**ffp-passport repo:** index.html, login.html, ffp-member-dashboard.html, manifest.webmanifest, sw.js, assets/ffp-pwa.js,
  assets/ffp-member.css, assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js (v149) + the 30 DELETIONS (provider/professional/junk).
  Also confirm assets/icons/ hold the NAVY icons (ffp-icon/apple-touch/favicon/maskable).
**ffp-professional repo:** index.html (sidebar mark fix + teal iOS launch links) + assets/startup/* already uploaded.
**ffp-partner repo:** login.html (blue), signup.html, _redirects, ffp-provider-auth.js v6, assets/ffp-logo.png — PLUS infra:
  GoDaddy CNAME, Netlify custom domain partner.findfitpeople.com, Vercel PROVIDER_DASH_URL. (Not yet live.)
**Vercel (backend):** deploy v149 (per-context email sender). **Resend:** findfitpeople.com now VERIFIED ✓.
**Device:** after ffppassport.com deploys, open it in Safari once (SW v2 takes over) → delete + re-add home-screen app → navy icon.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · REPO CLEANUP — Passport repo purged of cross-product files (30 deleted; Grant commits)
Grant: "zero confusion between repos and files." The ffp-passport repo physically held ALL four products' files. Verified
dead here (redirected to own domains; referenced by NOTHING in member/admin — grep=0) and DELETED (git keeps history):
Professional (6): ffp-professional-dashboard.html + 4 ffp-professional-*-loader.js + ffp-pro.webmanifest.
Partner (22): ffp-provider-dashboard.html + ffp-provider-auth.js + 18 ffp-provider-*-loader.js + provider-signup.html + partner.html.
Junk (2): __probe_test.js, ffp-auth-exchange-test.html.
Grant must COMMIT the deletions. NOTE the partner/pro SOURCE OF TRUTH is now their OWN repos (ffp-partner / ffp-professional).

### REPO MAP — the single source of truth for what lives where (do not re-mix)
- **ffp-passport** (→ ffppassport.com): MEMBER app + ADMIN + shared. Pages: index.html (landing), login.html, ffp-member-dashboard.html,
  my-passport.html, ffp-profile-complete.html, welcome/about/privacy/terms/refund.html, auth-handoff.html, ffp-admin-dashboard.html.
  JS: ffp-member-*-loader.js, ffp-admin-*-loader.js (incl. admin's providers/professionals PANELS — admin manages all), ffp-admin-auth.js,
  sw.js. Config: manifest.webmanifest, _redirects (301s old pro/partner paths to their domains). Shared libs: assets/*.js. Backend: assets/ffp-passport-backend-main.
- **ffp-professional** (→ ffpprofessional.com): index.html (app/gate at /app) + landing.html (/) + 4 ffp-professional-*-loader.js + ffp-pro.webmanifest + sw.js + _redirects + its OWN copy of shared assets/. SELF-CONTAINED ✓ (verified). OUTSTANDING: upload assets/startup/ launch-screen images (teal PWA launch added 2026-07-02 references them).
- **ffp-partner** (→ partner.findfitpeople.com): index.html (=provider dashboard) + login.html + signup.html + ffp-provider-auth.js v6 + all ffp-provider-*-loader.js + sw.js + _redirects + its OWN copy of shared assets/. NOT verified from here (folder not connected). Needs infra: CNAME + Netlify custom domain + Vercel PROVIDER_DASH_URL.
- **findfitpeople.com** (MARKETPLACE): Grant's SEPARATE Cowork chat/repo. Not in this session. Booking/discovery.
- SHARED SPINE (one for all): backend API (Vercel) + Supabase DB + ONE members account. Each frontend keeps its OWN COPY of shared assets/ libs (self-contained per repo); they are not cross-linked at runtime.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · ICON — TRUE FIX: index.html (the root-served page) had NO apple-touch-icon/manifest (awaiting deploy)
THE reason "Add to Home Screen" never showed the new icon after 10 tries: `ffppassport.com` root serves **index.html**
(via `/* → /index.html` in _redirects), and index.html's ENTIRE icon head was one line: `<link rel="icon" href="assets/
ffp-emblem.png">`. NO apple-touch-icon, NO manifest link. So iOS Add-to-Home-Screen from the root had no touch icon →
fell back to a page screenshot / raw emblem. Every earlier fix (sw.js, ?v=3, install-banner refs) was on login.html +
dashboard — NOT the landing page the root actually serves. FIX: added the full PWA head block to index.html — `<link
rel="manifest">`, `apple-touch-icon` → /assets/icons/ffp-apple-touch-180.png?v=3, favicons ?v=3, theme-color #081420,
apple-mobile-web-app-* metas. VERIFIED: the referenced icon file exists in assets/icons/. (Other static pages —
welcome/about/partner/privacy/terms — also lack apple-touch but aren't the primary add-to-home entry; can add later.)
DEPLOY: commit index.html. Then on device: Add ffppassport.com to Home Screen again → navy icon.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · ICON install-banner refs + TAGLINE "Your Active Lifestyle Community" (awaiting deploy)
ICON (final sweep): after the sw.js v2 fix, two hardcoded install-banner icon refs still pointed at the OLD icon with
NO cache-bust on a WHITE bg → that's the "still old icon when installing the webapp": (1) assets/ffp-pwa.js L44 install
banner, (2) ffp-member-dashboard.html L803 install row. Both → `/assets/icons/ffp-icon-192.png?v=3` + `background:#081420`
(navy, not white). Grant confirmed the 7 icon PNGs ARE uploaded to ffp-passport repo assets/icons/. Loader busts: ffp-pwa.js
?v=4→5 (login.html + member dashboard), so the banner change reaches devices.
TAGLINE "FFP Passport — Your Active Lifestyle Community" added in ALL spots Grant chose:
- login.html: `.logo-tag` line "Your Active Lifestyle Community" under the FFP PASSPORT wordmark.
- index.html (landing): <title> → "FFP Passport — Your Active Lifestyle Community"; hero eyebrow "The Active Lifestyle
  Passport" → "Your Active Lifestyle Community".
- manifest.webmanifest: description → "FFP Passport — Your Active Lifestyle Community." (shows when installing the webapp).
- ffp-member-dashboard.html topbar: "FFP Passport" + `.topbar-tag` sub "Your Active Lifestyle Community" (style in
  assets/ffp-member.css). FFP_BUILD 515→516; ffp-member.css ?v=483→516.
DEPLOY (ffp-passport repo): sw.js, assets/ffp-pwa.js, assets/ffp-member.css, ffp-member-dashboard.html, login.html,
index.html, manifest.webmanifest. Then on device: open ffppassport.com in Safari once (new SW takes over + purges old
icon cache), then delete + re-add the home-screen app. Must COMMIT MASTER.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · 4 GRANT TASKS: Passport login members-only + Passport icon + Pro launch teal + email sender (awaiting deploy)
1. **Passport login = MEMBERS ONLY + PASSPORT-BRANDED** — `login.html` v29→v31 (Building FFP Passport). v30: removed the Partner
   + Professional portal cards (they sign in on partner.findfitpeople.com / ffpprofessional.com now); only the FFP Passport
   (member) card remains and the page AUTO-ADVANCES straight to the member sign-in screen on load; admin still internal-only via
   /login#admin; removed the dead provider ?verified block. v31: login now carries the PASSPORT identity — FFP emblem medallion
   (assets/ffp-emblem.png) + "FFP PASSPORT" wordmark in BOTH the header and the launch splash (was the generic shared FFP orbit
   wordmark ffp-logo.png). Matches the member app's own lockup. v32: DARK theme — reverted the light redesign back to the navy
   #081420 brand (bg #081420, surface #0f1e2e, blue #1980AD, accent #2ba8e0, text #e8eef4, muted #8a99a8); re-themed every
   field/code/button/link + the "Become A Member" screen inline ink (#102230→light) + splash + theme-color meta. node --check
   main script: PASS. Real </body></html> intact (2nd match is inside the changelog comment).
2. **Passport PWA icon → FFP emblem on NAVY #081420** (REVISED — first tried #2ba8e0 electric blue per Grant's pick, but the
   emblem is a DARK medallion so it read as a dark blob on bright blue, nothing like the brand. Regenerated on the Passport navy
   #081420 to match the app splash + manifest — looks like the brand now). 7 PNGs from assets/ffp-emblem.png: ffp-icon-192/512,
   ffp-maskable-192/512 (66% safe zone), ffp-apple-touch-180, ffp-favicon-32/16. Delivered as outputs/ffp-passport-icons.zip →
   Grant uploads into ffp-passport repo assets/icons/ (OVERWRITE existing). manifest.webmanifest icon srcs bumped to ?v=3.
   ICON-NOT-SHOWING — TRUE ROOT CAUSE (2026-07-02): the SERVICE WORKER. `sw.js` v1 served `/assets/icons/*`
   CACHE-FIRST under a FIXED cache name `ffp-static-v1` that never bumped → the first icons a device ever cached
   were pinned forever; re-uploading icons + reinstalling did NOTHING because the SW answered from its stale cache
   before the network. FIX = `sw.js` v2: (1) cache name → `ffp-static-v2` so activate deletes the old cache
   (purges pinned icons); (2) icons now NETWORK-FIRST (fresh icon always wins online, cache = offline fallback
   only). node --check via the bash MOUNT falsely errored "Missing catch" — the mount truncated its read at L61;
   the Read tool confirms the file is intact + valid to L86 (RULE 3 mount-truncation, trust Read not the mount).
   Also-needed (secondary): the iOS home-screen icon comes from the `apple-touch-icon` <link>, NOT the manifest — those
   links (login.html L160 + ffp-member-dashboard.html L41) + the favicon links were un-versioned, so iOS kept serving the cached
   old icon. Bumped both to ?v=3. Grant MUST also: (a) upload the new navy ffp-apple-touch-180.png into assets/icons/, (b) verify
   https://ffppassport.com/assets/icons/ffp-apple-touch-180.png?v=3 loads (a 404 = file not uploaded = blank icon), (c) DELETE the
   installed home-screen app and re-Add — iOS never updates a home-screen icon in place.
3. **Pro PWA teal from icon tap** — the pro app already themed teal in-app (#0a3e44 theme-color + body + #pro-splash), but had NO
   iOS launch screens → white flash on tap. Added 12 apple-touch-startup-image links to FFP Professional app/index.html (teal +
   white FFP logo). Images delivered as outputs/ffp-pro-startup.zip → Grant uploads into ffp-professional repo assets/startup/.
   Grant kept the color as #0a3e44 (teal).
4b. **Per-context sender (v148→v149, 2026-07-02)** — added MAIL_FROM_BOOKING = "Find Fit People" <noreply@findfitpeople.com>
   + `mailFromFor(brand)`; `/api/notify/member` now sends from the Find Fit People address when the caller passes
   `brand:'booking'` (else defaults to the FFP Passport address). So the two noreply senders are cleanly separated.
   TODO Grant: (a) marketplace must pass `brand:'booking'` on its /api/notify/member calls (other chat); (b) authorise
   findfitpeople.com SPF+DKIM in Resend so noreply@findfitpeople.com actually delivers (until then override env MAIL_FROM_BOOKING
   or booking mail may bounce/spam). Deploy backend v149 on Vercel.
4. **Email sender split** — backend index.js v147→v148: MAIL_FROM default changed "Find Fit People" → "FFP Passport"
   (<noreply@ffppassport.com>). Passport mail now reads "FFP Passport". Marketplace keeps "Find Fit People" in its OWN build
   (Grant's other chat). CAVEAT logged in-code (~L1067): /api/notify/member (which the marketplace also calls) inherits this same
   MAIL_FROM, so those member notifications now read "FFP Passport" too — brand per-context later if marketplace booking mail must
   say "Find Fit People". Backend awaiting Vercel deploy by Grant.
DEPLOY: commit login.html + manifest.webmanifest + backend index.js (Building FFP Passport repo) + upload the icon zip; commit
index.html + upload the startup zip (ffp-professional repo). Must COMMIT MASTER.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · PARTNER SIGNUP → partner.findfitpeople.com (self-contained; awaiting Grant deploy)
Grant DECISION (2026-07-02): partner signup now lives on partner.findfitpeople.com (signup + login + dashboard = ONE origin →
the cross-origin hand-off blocker in PROVIDER-SIGNUP-HANDOFF-DECISION.md / -REBUILD-FOR-BOOKING.md is MOOT). This supersedes the
2026-06-25 "signup moves to findfitpeople.com" decision (that predated the dashboard split).
- **NEW `signup.html`** (partner repo): REUSES the exact field set + phone-code picker (ccRender/ccPick, FFP_TAX.phoneCodes) +
  country→city cascade (data-ffp-loc, ffp-location-picker.js) + `POST /api/provider/signup` submit + FFPAuth persist from the old
  ffppassport.com/provider-signup.html (v3). Only chrome changed → light BLUE partner theme matching login.html. Success redirect
  now → `/` (this origin's dashboard), NOT the old '/ffp-provider-dashboard.html'. Deps already in partner repo: ffp-constants,
  ffp-taxonomy, ffp-location-picker, ffp-api-integration, ffp-analytics. node --check both script blocks: PASS. Ends </body></html>.
- **`_redirects`** (partner repo) updated: `/login → /login.html 200`, `/signup → /signup.html 200`, then `/* → /index.html 200`.
- **`login.html`** (partner repo) updated: unknown-email copy now points to "Create an account" (self-serve) instead of "Contact FFP";
  added a "New partner? Create an account" → /signup link on the email screen.
TODO Grant: upload signup.html + updated _redirects + updated login.html to ffp-partner repo. Retire the old
ffppassport.com/provider-signup.html (redirect → partner.findfitpeople.com/signup). Repoint marketplace "Become a partner" CTAs →
partner.findfitpeople.com/signup (marketplace = your other chat). NOTE: /api/provider/signup returns redirect '/ffp-provider-dashboard.html'
— harmless (signup.html forces '/'), but backend could be updated to return '/' later. Must COMMIT MASTER.

## LATEST — 2026-07-02 · PARTNER 404 FIXED — standalone sign-in for partner.findfitpeople.com (awaiting Grant deploy)
ROOT CAUSE: the partner app 404'd at `/login` because ffp-provider-auth.js is only a role GUARD — on no session it does
`location.href='/login'`, which existed on ffppassport.com (Passport login) but NOT on the standalone partner origin. Partner
had no sign-in of its own (its in-page #auth-screen is dead legacy, hidden by the guard). FIX (3 files):
- **NEW `login.html`** (partner repo) — self-contained Partner sign-in. COPIES ffppassport.com/login.html head/styles/splash +
  the EXACT auth mechanics (native Supabase OTP → shared backend `/api/auth/exchange` → app-JWT via FFPAuth), stripped to the
  Partner portal only (green #22c55e; no member/professional picker, no signup/plan screens). prepare-signin preflight
  (shouldCreateUser:false) so no orphan auth users / dead confirm emails. On success → `location.href='/'` (dashboard=index.html
  on this origin). Auto-redirects a returning provider with a live session straight to `/`. Handles ?verified=1&email= prefill.
  Deps it needs in the partner repo: `assets/ffp-api-integration.js` (window.supabase + FFPAuth), `assets/ffp-logo.png`,
  `assets/icons/*` — all already present (dashboard uses them). node --check on the inline JS: PASS. Ends `</script></body></html>` (RULE 3.1 verified).
- **NEW `_redirects`** (partner repo): `/login → /login.html 200` THEN `/* → /index.html 200` (order matters — /login before the catch-all).
- **`ffp-provider-auth.js` v5→v6** (Building FFP Passport; upload to partner repo too): wrong-role bounce now uses ABSOLUTE
  ffppassport.com URLs (member→https://ffppassport.com/ , admin→https://ffppassport.com/login#admin) instead of same-origin
  `/ffp-*-dashboard.html` paths — those don't exist on partner.* and, under the `/*`→index fallback, would loop forever.
  No-session still bounces to relative `/login` (= partner login here, Passport login there). Correct on BOTH origins.
LOOP CHECK: provider no-session → /login → login.html → sign in → session set (this origin) → `/` → guard finds member → granted.
No loop. (Pre-existing edge unchanged: a role='provider' with NO providers row still bounces to /login — onboarding gap, not this fix.)
INCOMPLETE / NOT LIVE: files are local — Grant must upload `login.html` + `_redirects` + updated `ffp-provider-auth.js` to the
ffp-partner repo, plus set GoDaddy CNAME `partner` → <site>.netlify.app (the earlier screenshot had the value wrong: it was
`http://partner.findfitpeople.com` — must be the `.netlify.app` hostname, no protocol), add partner.findfitpeople.com as a
custom domain in Netlify, and set Vercel `PROVIDER_DASH_URL=https://partner.findfitpeople.com`. STILL PENDING per Grant's model:
partner login "via findfitpeople.com" (marketplace handoff) — this self-contained gate is the working interim and can switch to
handoff later without breaking anything. Must COMMIT MASTER.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · COACH MOMENTUM BUG FIX + COACH LEARNS HABITS (backend v145→v146; awaiting deploy)
**[b] Coach now LEARNS activity habits + is a positive influence** (Grant: "it needs to learn about the person's
activity habits and provide a positive influence"). `computeCoachProfile` pulls 120 days (was 45) and derives real
habits into `facts`: `favourites` (top-3 activities), `variety`, `typical_session_min`, `weekend_share`
(weekday-regular vs weekend-warrior %), `longest_streak`. The memory `summary` prompt, the `coach_line` prompt and
`coachLineFallback` now coach FROM these patterns and are explicitly a positive influence (reinforce active identity,
celebrate progress) — while still protecting streaks. Chat inherits it (it already sends `facts`). Verified: isolated
`node --check` of computeCoachProfile+fallback OK (COACH_HABITS_SYNTAX_OK); habit keys present. Same file/version as [a].

**[a] Momentum bug** — "slipping" told to a 30-day-streak member (backend v145→v146; awaiting deploy)
Grant (bug): Coach said "48 walks in 30 days — brilliant consistency" then "your momentum is slipping" — for the platform's MOST consistent member, right after training this morning. Root cause: `momentum` in `computeCoachProfile` was a naive 7-day-vs-prior-7-day activity COUNT (`thisW<lastW → 'slipping'`) with ZERO streak awareness — a couple of double-days last week made this week read as a "drop". Plus the 24h profile cache meant this-morning's session wasn't even counted.
- **Backend v146** (`index.js`; tail `module.exports = app;` L5967):
  - `computeCoachProfile` now computes a real consecutive-day `streak` + `logged_today` (same UTC-day basis as support_ops, from the 45-day activity pull — no new RPC).
  - **momentum is STREAK-AWARE:** `streak>=7 → 'rising'`; else `thisW>lastW → 'rising'`; else `'slipping'` ONLY on a real drop (`thisW < lastW-1`) AND `streak<2`; else `'steady'`. `facts` now carry `streak`/`logged_today`; `at_risk` requires `streak===0`.
  - coach_line AI prompt + `coachLineFallback` + `/api/coach/chat` prompt all: celebrate a 3+ streak / logged-today and NEVER say "slipping" or "you've been away" to a consistent member. Fallback reordered: low-recovery → streak → at-risk → recovered → momentum.
  - **Staleness fix:** `/api/coach/profile` recomputes (instead of serving the 24h cache) once the member has an `activity_logs` row newer than the profile's `updated_at` — so "trained this morning" is reflected immediately. (Self-heals Grant's case on next open since he logged today.)
- **Verified:** isolated `node --check` OK for `computeCoachProfile`+`coachLineFallback` and the `/api/coach/profile` handler; all edit strings present; `module.exports=app;` intact (L5967). (Full-file `node --check` throws a FALSE EOF at L5602 = the known bash-mount truncation, well past the edits.)
- **DEPLOY:** commit `index.js` (v146). No DB/frontend change. Backend v145 was already deployed (coach_line is live), so v146 replaces it.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · WHOOP readiness restored UNDER Coach Grant (member FFP_BUILD 514→515; awaiting deploy)
Grant: "Put the whoop details back in under Coach Grant." Re-added the daily readiness strip (recovery / sleep / strain / rest HR / HRV) that was removed with the Trends card.
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (**FFP_BUILD 514→515**): re-added `<div id="trend-fitness">` directly below `#ffp-coach-mount`; `renderTrend()` now calls `renderTrendFitness()` again (the function was left defined). Strip still hides itself for members with no wearable (reads `/api/wearables/daily`).
- **Verified:** 38 script blocks / 0 errors; `#trend-fitness` present (1); `renderTrendFitness` defined + called; FFP_BUILD 515.
- **DEPLOY:** commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 515). No DB/backend change.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · PASSPORT DECLUTTER — removed "Your Trends" + "Support Your Crew" cards; Coach Grant is the single coaching surface (member FFP_BUILD 513→514; awaiting deploy)
Grant (redirect, replaces the #1 cohort-in-Trends plan): "'Your Trends' and 'Support Your Crew' need to be removed from the passport panel — Coach Grant covers these two (well, should do)." So the standalone cards are gone and Coach owns coaching/trends/crew.
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (**FFP_BUILD 513→514**):
  - REMOVED the `#trend-card` block (the "Your Trends" chip + review line + vs-last-week + 8-week sparkline + the `#trend-fitness` WHOOP-readiness strip) and the `#trend-crew` "Support Your Crew" card.
  - `#ffp-coach-mount` (the Coach Grant card from #37) now stands ALONE where Trends was — it's the single coaching surface (`margin:6px 0 28px`).
  - `renderTrend()` gutted to just `ffpCoach.render()` (name kept so `renderAll()` + the 5-min refresh still repaint the Coach card). `renderTrendFitness()` no longer called; `renderTrendCrew()` still called by old sites but its mount is gone → both are safe no-ops (left defined).
- **NOTE (WHOOP readiness):** the "Today · from WHOOP" recovery/sleep/strain strip lived inside the Trends card and was removed with it. Coach's card still shows recovery in its state badge. If Grant wants the full readiness strip back, restore `renderTrendFitness` into its own element (easy) — flagged, not assumed.
- Cohort comparison (original #1) is NOT built in-app — superseded by this consolidation. `member_stat_rankings(p_me)` (city+gender rank for VO2/bench/5k/bodyfat/active-time) still exists and still feeds the WEEKLY EMAIL; it can later become something Coach answers in chat if wanted.
- **Verified:** member dashboard 38 script blocks / 0 parse errors; `trend-card`/`trend-review`/`trend-spark` = 0 occurrences; `ffp-coach-mount` present; FFP_BUILD 514; tail intact `</script></body></html>` (L8639).
- **DEPLOY:** commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 514). No DB/backend change. (Coach loader + backend v145 from the prior entry still awaiting their deploy too.)

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · #37 DONE — Coach Grant = active-lifestyle coach + Talk-to-Coach chat (DB LIVE; backend v145 + member FFP_BUILD 512→513 awaiting deploy)
Grant: Coach shouldn't be "6 templated lines" — he wants an **active-lifestyle coach that reads the person's lifestyle, supports them regularly, and can be talked to for support**. Key finding: a rich coach engine ALREADY existed (`member_coach_profile` + `computeCoachProfile` reads 30d cadence, week momentum, top activity, days-since-active, at-risk, WHOOP recovery/strain/7d sleep, connections, support_ops; AI already wrote a `summary`) — the member app just ignored it and showed 9 canned tips. So this SURFACES the engine + adds conversation.
- **DB LIVE (migration `coach_chat_messages_and_coach_line`):** added `member_coach_profile.coach_line text`; new table `member_coach_messages` (id, member_id, role check user|coach, content, created_at; idx member_id+created_at desc; RLS enabled).
- **Backend v145** (`index.js`, ends `module.exports = app;` L5938):
  - `computeCoachProfile` now also writes a **member-facing `coach_line`** — 2nd person, ONE concrete next step, adapts to state (AI via ANTHROPIC_KEY/WORKOUT_MODEL + `coachLineFallback(facts)` rules). Returned by `/api/coach/profile` (cache still 24h; recomputes if coach_line missing).
  - **NEW `POST /api/coach/chat {refresh,message}`** — Claude grounded in THIS member's summary + facts + last 8 activity_logs + first name + last 10 turns from member_coach_messages; persists user+coach messages; NOT-a-doctor guard; never another member's health. First-message-must-be-user guard for the Anthropic API.
  - **NEW `POST /api/coach/history {refresh}`** — returns the thread (oldest→newest, last 30).
- **Frontend — NEW lazy loader `assets/ffp-coach-loader.js?v=513`** (156 lines, mirrors ffp-workout-loader pattern; keeps this OUT of the monolith): `ffpCoach.render()` paints a state-aware Coach card into `#ffp-coach-mount` (coach_line + recovery/momentum/at-risk badge + adaptive action chips: Log activity → `openLogModal()`, Find a meet-up → clicks the meetups nav item, Talk to Coach → chat). `ffpCoach.openChat()` = **full-screen full-bleed** chat (per the modal convention) → `/api/coach/chat` + `/api/coach/history`, typing indicator, Enter-to-send.
  - `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (**FFP_BUILD 512→513**): replaced the `#trend-tip` line with `#ffp-coach-mount`; deleted the 9 canned rotating tips in `renderTrend` (now just `ffpCoach.render()`); added the loader `<script defer>`. Net: REMOVED inline logic, added a loader → aligns with the shrink-the-monolith priority.
- **Verified (Rule 3/4):** backend `node --check` clean to the mount-truncation point (all edits well before it); real tails confirmed via Read (backend L5938, member L8693 `})();</script></body></html>`); coach loader `node --check` OK; member dashboard = 38 script blocks, 0 parse errors; FFP_BUILD 513, mount+script present, old tips gone. **NOT yet live-tested** against prod (endpoints undeployed — Grant deploys) — smoke-test /api/coach/chat after deploy.
- **DEPLOY:** DB already live. Commit `index.js` (v145), `assets/ffp-coach-loader.js`, `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (Build 513). Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel env (already used by AI Coach/workout). After deploy: open Passport → Coach Grant card → "Talk to Coach".

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · #40 DONE — Share card: selectable info + HR zones + coloured sticker (member FFP_BUILD 511→512; awaiting deploy)
Grant: share card needs an **Options button + checklist** (not chips — "unprofessional"), a locked **Main** row so people see the headline, **Photo + Sticker stay toggles**, **HR-zones** as an includable field, and **colour/graphic on the sticker** (chose the HR-zones bar; `km` in yellow #FFCC00).
- **Data verified first (Rule 0):** logged activities live in `activity_logs`. Real coverage across 171 rows / member data — avg HR 101, distance 49, **max_hr 67**, **hr_zones_ms 66**, **strain 64** (all in `metrics` jsonb, from WHOOP), steps 4. **Elevation & grade DROPPED** — not captured per-activity (grade is a profile skill level, elevation logged nowhere).
- **All edits INLINE in `ffp-member-dashboard.html`** (existing share block ~L7265–7535; a full extraction to a loader is a separate planned task, not big-banged into this). Files/functions:
  - `_ffpShareFields(a)` (NEW) — ordered field catalog `{key,label,val,unit,avail,kind}` for date, location, time, pace, speed, avghr, maxhr, calories, steps, strain, hrzones. Values/format REUSE the activity-detail ribbon logic (Rule 5): pace calc, steps `k`, `metrics.max_hr/strain/hr_zones_ms`.
  - `_ffpDrawZones(ctx,a,pad,y,W,U,fam)` + `_ffpRoundRect` (NEW) — coloured Z0–Z5 stacked bar on the card, **same zone keys/colours as the detail view** (Z1 #3aa0e6 … Z5 #dc2626).
  - `_ffpMakeCardCanvas` — rewrote the info section to a **flowing, config-driven layout** (title→hero→sub→zones→stats grid→footer), gated by `_ffpShareCfg.show{}`; hero `km` unit in **#FFCC00**; **adaptive squeeze** `q=min(1,region/rawH)` so any number of ticked fields always fits above the footer (never overflows). Stats grid reflows 3-per-row, no 3-cap.
  - `_ffpShareCfg.show` + `_ffpDefaultShow(a)` (all-available default), `_ffpCurKey` now includes the show-set (preview re-caches on toggle), `ffpShareToggleField`, `ffpShareToggleOptions` (NEW handlers).
  - Share sheet: **Options button** + hidden **checklist panel** (`#ffp-sc-opts`) — locked "Activity + headline" Main row, then one checkbox per available field. Photo + Sticker toggles unchanged.
- **Verified (Rule 3/4):** ran the real canvas code in isolation across 3 scenarios (WHOOP run w/ zones+8 stats, gym time-hero no-zones, 9:16 story) + worst-case squeeze test with a footer guide-line → no overflow, `km` yellow, zones coloured. All 37 complete `<script>` blocks parse 0 errors; file ends `})();</script></body></html>` (L8705, true count — the "13,737 lines" note is STALE; file is 8705). Bash mount truncates at ~8551 (known issue) — edits are well before that and parse clean.
- **INCOMPLETE / follow-on:** none for #40. Sticker zone-bar inherits the sticker halo shadow (acceptable). HR-zones only shows for WHOOP-synced activities (3 members today); manual logs won't have the option — expected.
- **DEPLOY:** commit `ffp-member-dashboard.html` only (FFP_BUILD **512**). No DB/backend change. Confirm the avatar menu shows Build 512, open an activity → Share card → Options.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · #41 FIXED — member push no longer shows "from FFP Pro" (backend v144; DB live; frontend awaiting deploy)
Root cause: `push_subscriptions` / `device_push_tokens` had NO app tag, so `sendPushToMember` sent to EVERY subscription under a member_id — including the one the FFP Pro PWA registered (a pro is also a member) → the Pro service worker rendered it with Pro branding.
- **DB LIVE:** added `app text not null default 'member'` to `push_subscriptions` + `device_push_tokens`.
- **Backend v144:** `/api/push/subscribe` + `/api/push/register-device` now store `app` (validated: professional|provider|booking|member). `sendPushToMember` (web) + `sendFcmToMember` (native) filter `.eq('app','member')` — member pushes reach ONLY the member PWA.
- **Frontend:** `assets/ffp-pwa.js` (web subscribe) + `assets/ffp-native-push.js` (native register ×2) tag the app from `location.pathname` (`/professional/`→professional, `/provider|partner/`→provider, `/booking/`→booking, else member). Cache-bust `ffp-pwa.js?v=3→4` in ffp-member-dashboard.html, ffp-professional-dashboard.html, login.html.
- **Existing subs (6 rows) default 'member' → re-tag on next app open** (each PWA re-subscribes with its app). So once Grant opens the Pro app after deploy, his Pro sub flips to 'professional' and stops receiving member pushes. Verified: backend filters present (L2908/2964), subscribe/register store app (L2980/3019), file ends `module.exports = app;` (L5863); ffp-pwa.js + ffp-native-push.js `node --check` OK.
- **DEPLOY:** index.js v144; assets ffp-pwa.js + ffp-native-push.js; the 3 HTML files (ffp-pwa.js?v=4). DB already live.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · STREAK REWARDS ($20@14 / $50@30) + daily nudge (DB LIVE; backend v141 awaiting deploy)
Grant's 14/30-day activity-streak habit-builder. Currency = **USD** (the `_aed` column names are legacy; balance = sum(`transactions.amount_aed` treated as USD), min payout $250).
- **DB LIVE:** `member_activity_streak(p_me)` — consecutive days with an activity, ending today/yesterday, with **ONE make-up save** (a single missed day is bridged if the member has any day with 2+ posts). `members.streak_rewards` jsonb. Trigger `activity_streak_reward` on `activity_logs` insert → at 14 days credits **$20**, at 30 credits **$50**, each once, as a `transactions` `type:'in', status:'paid', category:'streak'` row (so it shows in earnings) + a "You earned $X!" bell notification. **Existing streaks SEEDED** (`d14/d30` marked) so nobody is back-paid; forward crossings still pay (e.g. Sunjay @24 will earn $50 at 30). Verified: Grant streak 31 (seeded both), Sunjay 24 (seeded d14; 1 missed day rescued by his save), others fresh.
- **Backend v141 (deploy):** `GET /api/cron/streak-nudge` (vercel.json daily 14:00 UTC) — evening `notifyMember` push to anyone who hasn't logged **today**: streak-holders "Keep your N-day streak", new members (<14d) "Day X of your first 14". cronAuthed; `?only` test. index.js ends `module.exports = app;` (L5809).
- **DECISION made:** existing long streaks NOT back-paid (safe with real money) — flip if Grant wants to reward Grant/Sunjay's current streaks.
- **REWARD IS $50 TOTAL (not $70):** $20 at 14 days, then **+$30 at 30 days** = $50 cumulative. Trigger updated (30-day inserts $30, category `challenges` — 'streak' violated the category check). Grant corrected 50→30 (streak total $50, balance $70.60 incl. referrals); Sunjay $20.
- **PASSPORT UI BUILT (lazy):** new `assets/ffp-streak-loader.js` (self-booting IIFE, reads `member_streak_status(p_me)` RPC, member id from `localStorage.ffp_member`). Renders a compact dark streak card into `#ffp-streak-mount` (added in panel-passport above World Map). Shows flame + N-day streak, posted-today status, progress bar to next milestone (Next: $20 / "$50 total"), days-to-next. `window.ffpStreak.refresh()` called on load + panel-passport re-open. Dashboard: mount div + `<script ...ffp-streak-loader.js?v=1>` (after connections-core) + refresh hook; `FFP_BUILD 510→511`. RPC `member_streak_status` LIVE. Loader `node --check` OK.
- **DEPLOY (all awaiting Grant):** backend `index.js` v141 + `vercel.json` (streak-nudge cron); frontend `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (511) + new `assets/ffp-streak-loader.js`. DB (streak fn, trigger, RPC, credits) already LIVE.
- **2026-07-01 WEEKLY SUMMARY RESKIN (backend v143):** `renderSundaySummary` moved off the dark theme onto the LIGHT brand (navy hero + white `ffp-logo-white.png` + kicker + greeting folded into hero; white body; brand-blue `ssEye` section headers; gold `C.gold` for former yellow text; light `#e2e9f0` bar tracks; yellow CTA; navy "Find Fit People" signoff + light `#e3ebf2` footer; 500→600px, outer `#dfe6ed`). Palette-flip approach (C.white=navy ink) — data/sections unchanged. Verified via isolated render (dark bg gone, logo present; the "Closest: NaN" seen locally is only the stubbed SS_TARGETS in the test harness — real constants compute fine).
- **ONBOARDING COMPLETE (all 6):** (1) welcome reskin ✓ (2) webapp=step 1 ✓ (3) 14-day streak challenge ✓ (streak engine + card + Day-1 intro in welcome + daily push) (4) weekly "Near you this week" ✓ (5) profile reminder ✓ (6) we-miss-you ✓.
- **2026-07-01 WEEKLY "NEAR YOU" (backend v142):** RPC `member_weekly_opportunities(p_me)` → {matches: top 3 unconnected by shared sport/city, meetups: up to 3 upcoming in city/region next 10 days not hosted/joined}. Handler calls it → `d.opportunities`; `renderSundaySummary` adds the dark "Near you this week" section (people to connect + meet-ups), inserted after fitHtml, hides when empty. Streak intro moved to Day 1 (welcome email) — NO separate day-2 email (was "one day late"). Welcome steps 2–4 = box-free rows + hairline dividers (Grant: boxes back = no). Verified: renderSundaySummary renders with section (isolated eval).

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · ONBOARDING START — welcome email reskin + summaries mandatory (backend v139; awaiting deploy)
- **Summaries not opt-out (v139):** removed the `no_monthly_email` / `no_weekly_email` skips in monthly-wrapup + sunday-summary. Members can't opt out of summaries. (Grant: "Summary opt out is not possible" — only leaving the platform. Other emails' opt-outs untouched — there wasn't a separate newsletter opt-out.)
- **Welcome email reskinned** (`sendWelcomeEmail`, fires on `/api/onboard/from-stripe`): was the old dark 480px box; now the new brand — navy hero + white FFP logo + "Welcome to FFP, {name}", light/white alternating step bands, yellow "What's a Meet?" callout, Find-Fit-People signoff + light footer. **Install-the-app is now STEP 1** (Grant: "make it the first step as it delivers the real experience") with the iOS/Android add-to-home-screen instructions in a highlighted card; steps 2–4 = complete profile / Meet & Move / join-or-host. Subject → "Welcome to Find Fit People, {name}". Verified: function parses clean (isolated `new Function`).
- **2026-07-01 LIFECYCLE ENGINE BUILT (backend v140 + admin v57; DB live; awaiting deploy):** `members.lifecycle_sent` jsonb column LIVE (migration `members_lifecycle_sent`). New `ffpLifecycleEmail()` brand shell + `sendProfileReminderEmail` + `sendWinbackEmail` (both new-brand, verified render 2605/2557 chars). New **GET `/api/cron/lifecycle`** (cronAuthed; daily 07:00 UTC in vercel.json): per active member — **complete-profile reminder** when incomplete 3+ days after signup (once, flagged), **we-miss-you** when profile complete + 7+ days inactive (max once / 21 days). `?only=<email|id>` + `?preview=profile|winback` force-send for testing. Admin Emails panel: new **"Onboarding & reminders"** card (Preview profile / Preview we-miss-you → uses "Send test to" field; Run now) + `AdminEmails.lifecycle()`; admin build v56→v57. index.js ends `module.exports = app;` (L5772, verified). This delivers onboarding #5 (profile reminder) + #6 (we-miss-you).
- **Onboarding sequence — STILL TO BUILD:** (2) Convert-to-webapp = FOLDED into welcome (done). (3) 14-day starter challenge (new email + starter quest via the quest engine). (4) Weekly summary + Connections & Meet-up-opportunities section. (5) Complete-profile reminder (~day 3 if incomplete — why Vivian missed the wrap-up). (6) "We miss you" after 7 days inactive. Mechanism to build: daily lifecycle cron + `members.lifecycle_sent` jsonb flags, one-time sends, manual buttons in the Emails panel.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · WORLD MAP — activity filter + pin accuracy + modal z-index (member FFP_BUILD 509→510; awaiting deploy)
`ffp-member-dashboard.html` JourneyMap. Three things, all edits to existing inline code (no new module):
- **#36 Filter by activity type:** reused the already-wired `state.selectedActivity` lens (`logsInRange`). Added an **Activity** `<select id="jm-activity">` to the Map Filters modal (above Location) + `setMapActivity(v)` → renderAll. Options populated in `renderPassportPicker()` from distinct `LOGS.activity` (most-used first). Counted in `updateMapFilterUI()` badge; reset in `clearMapFilters()`.
- **#35 Pin accuracy:** city cluster markers now sit on the **centroid of that city's real logged GPS coords** (`latSum/lngSum/gc` accumulated per city → `cityCoord(c)`), falling back to the `coordsForCity` dictionary only when a city has NO geo-tagged activity — so cities missing from the dictionary are no longer silently dropped, and pins land on the actual activity locations. Both cluster loops (country + world) use `cityCoord`.
- **Modal z-index:** the FFP header (`.topbar` z-index:100) was painting over the filter modal. Added `#map-filter-backdrop{z-index:100060;}` AND `openMapFilters()` now `document.body.appendChild(bd)` before opening, so it escapes any ancestor stacking context. `FFP_BUILD` 509→510. Verified: functions parse clean (setMapActivity/clearMapFilters/openMapFilters), select + cityCoord + both loop swaps present.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · WRAP-UP HERO → Quest-card style + FFP logo (backend v138; awaiting deploy)
Grant: the flat photo band looked "stupid" + emails must carry the FFP logo. Rebuilt the `ffpWrapupEmail` hero to the **Quest-feature-card** treatment: a `<td background="…photo…" bgcolor="#0d2b45">` cell (email-safe, navy fallback if Gmail strips the bg image) with the **white FFP logo** (`site-images/ffp-logo-white.png`) top-left and the **title + stats overlaid** on a bottom-anchored dark gradient (was a separate navy band + full-width `<img>`). Replaced `heroBand + heroImg` with a single `heroCard`. brandEmail-based emails already carry the logo, so all emails now do. Header → v138. Verified via isolated-function render (logo + bg cell present). CAVEAT flagged to Grant: Gmail td background-image support is inconsistent → best case photo, worst case clean navy — confirm on device.
Also this turn (admin build unchanged): **multi-recipient test** — the Emails panel "Send test to" field + `monthly-wrapup`/`sunday-summary` `only` parse a comma-separated email/id list.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · ADMIN → EMAILS PANEL — send batch emails off admin login, no CRON_SECRET (backend v137 + admin v54; awaiting Grant deploy)
Root problem: Grant kept hitting `{"error":"unauthorized"}` triggering sends via `?secret=` in a browser (special chars in CRON_SECRET get mangled in the URL; the auto-cron works because Vercel sends it in the `Authorization: Bearer` header). Fix = stop needing the secret in a URL.
- **Backend `index.js` → v137:** new `async function cronAuthed(req)` (just above the meetup-reminders route). Accepts EITHER CRON_SECRET (header or `?secret=`, whitespace-trimmed) OR `?admin_id=<admin_users.id>` (validated against `admin_users`, same gate the broadcast endpoint uses). Swapped the auth check on FOUR batch endpoints to `if (!(await cronAuthed(req))) return 401`: `/api/cron/monthly-wrapup`, `/sunday-summary`, `/meetup-reminders`, `/coach-nudges`. (coach-profiles left secret-only.) Trim also kills any stray-newline false 401.
- **Admin `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` → build v54:** new sidebar link **Emails** + `#panel-emails` + `AdminEmails.run(job,mode,btn)` (posts `?admin_id=<FFP_ADMIN.id>`; test = `&only=<FFP_ADMIN.email>&force=1`, all = `&force=1`; meetup-reminders just runs due items; coach-nudges is bell/push). Four cards: Monthly wrap-up (test + send-all), Weekly summary (test + send-all), Meet-up reminders (Run now), Coach nudges (test + run-all; labelled in-app not email). Reuses existing `panel`/`section`/`btn`/`btn-blue` styles + `window.FFP_ADMIN`. Registered in `panelNames`. Footer stamp v53→v54.
- **How Grant sends now:** Admin → Emails → type recipient(s) in **"Send test to"** → *Send test* (monthly wrap-up) → check inbox → *Send to everyone*. No secret, no curl, no URL.
- **2026-07-01 FOLLOW-UPS (admin build v56):** (1) fixed the "Send test" ghost buttons that rendered dark-on-dark (now blue-outlined, light text). (2) **REMOVED Coach nudges** from the Emails panel — it's a bell/push notification (the daily proactive Coach + support-your-crew message), NOT an email, so it didn't belong. (3) Added a **"Send test to"** input (comma-separated emails/ids; blank = admin's own) driving every Send-test button. Backend: `member` query in BOTH `monthly-wrapup` (L5617) and `sunday-summary` (L5327) now parse `only` as a comma list → `.in('email',[…])` / `.in('id',[…])`. Panel emails remaining: Monthly wrap-up (test+all), Weekly summary (test+all), Meet-up reminders (Run now).
- **Verify:** backend `cronAuthed` present + wired 4×; file ends `module.exports = app;` (line 5654, Read-verified); AdminEmails JS parsed clean (isolated `new Function`). Full-file `node --check` false-EOFs on the mount truncation (RULE 3) — not a real error.
- **INCOMPLETE:** Grant commits BOTH files (`index.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`). Note: GitHub showed the deployed index.js header as v136 but commit msg "v138" — reconcile the number on commit; my edits are additive on the v136 file content.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · MONTHLY WRAP-UP EMAIL — world-class redesign (backend v136; DB live; frontend awaiting Grant deploy)
Grant: the June wrap-up email was content-good but "brand-destroying" ugly (dark-theme body text washed out on the white 480px `brandEmail` shell). Full redesign, built + verified against REAL data, NOT yet deployed (Grant commits index.js).
- **DB (LIVE now):** new RPC `member_monthly_wrapup_v2(p_me,p_from,p_to)` — wraps canonical v1 and adds: `active_days`, `prev_active_days`, `prev_minutes`, `compare` (all-members + gender/age cohort avg + "Top X%", **gated: only if cohort ≥5, gender+decade slice falls back to gender-only then hides**), `connections` (you-vs-your-connections leaderboard: board[], my_rank, conn_total, pct_more — gated ≥3 connections), `matches` (top-3 NEW people by shared sports/city/country → real % score, excludes already-connected; **null if none**). Migration `member_monthly_wrapup_v2`. v1 left intact.
- **Backend `index.js` → v136 (awaiting Grant commit):** new module-level builder `ffpWrapupEmail(o)` = self-contained **full-width 600px email doc** (NOT the `brandEmail` 480px shell), email-safe: tables for all horizontal layout, div-width bars (no absolute markers), **QuickChart doughnut** for the activity pie (`quickchart.io/chart?...` — Gmail strips SVG so a rendered PNG is used), grouped You/Average bars for the compare block. Sections: brand hero (gradient + storage photo) → Coach Grant (Connect→Commend→Recommend, generated from data) → activity doughnut+legend → WHAT YOU DID bars → CONNECT+ENGAGE (avatars+meetups/connections/cities) → YOU vs YOUR CONNECTIONS leaderboard → FIT PEOPLE FOR YOU matches (hidden when null) → month-vs-month table → HOW YOU COMPARE cohort → CTA + "Find Fit People" signoff + feedback. "Find Fit People" motif woven through (hero kicker, Coach close, Connect+Engage, matches title, signoff). Handler `/api/cron/monthly-wrapup` now calls v2, computes prevMonName/daysInMonth, sends the full doc for active members; quiet-member branch relit to LIGHT theme (dark ink on white). Header bumped v135→v136. File ends `module.exports = app;` (verified). `node --check` PASS (full 5626-line file, not truncated this run).
- **Hero image:** pulled from Supabase `site-images` bucket via image-transform URL `…/storage/v1/render/image/public/site-images/calories-in-park.png?width=1000&quality=68` (single constant `HERO_IMG` in the handler — one-line swap; Grant to confirm which photo on test).
- **Verified:** ran `ffpWrapupEmail` with Grant's REAL June v2 data (47 activities, 122.2km, 39h17m, top Running, #2 of 9 connections behind Sunjay 57, Top 13% all / Top 29% Men 40–49, matches=null since he's already connected to all matches) → rendered the exact HTML in a preview: looks world-class. Both external images (QuickChart + Supabase transform) resolve.
- **2026-07-01 REBUILD (boxes→bands):** Grant: the stacked identical rounded white cards were "brand-destroying" (the exact repeat mistake he'd flagged). Rewrote `ffpWrapupEmail` from per-section cards to **full-bleed alternating bands** — no borders/rounded cards: dark hero → photo → LIGHT Coach strip (blue top-accent rule, no card) → WHITE activity+bars (hairline divider) → NAVY Connect+Engage punch (stats as inline dark-band numbers, not white chips) → WHITE leaderboard → WHITE June-vs-May → LIGHT How-you-compare → WHITE CTA → NAVY "Find Fit People" signoff → LIGHT feedback → DARK footer (bookends the hero). Data logic unchanged; QuickChart pie + Supabase hero unchanged. `node --check` on the isolated function eval = clean (full-file check false-EOFs on the mount truncation — RULE 3). Same `member_monthly_wrapup_v2`.
- **2026-07-01 FIX-2 (patterns + de-dark):** Grant: graphs lost their patterns + the navy Connect+Engage/signoff/footer slabs were ugly. Re-added diagonal `repeating-linear-gradient` texture to ALL bars (what-you-did, leaderboard, compare "You") over a solid-color fallback (Outlook-safe). Relit Connect+Engage to a soft-blue gradient band (blue stat numbers, white-ringed avatars). Signoff → white band w/ blue type; footer → light. Only dark surface now = the hero. Reordered bands so tints alternate (coach L / activity W / connect blue / leaderboard W / compare L / vs-May W). Verified via isolated-function eval on real data.
- **INCOMPLETE / next:** (1) Grant must **commit `index.js`** → Vercel deploys v136. (2) Then **send test** to Grant: `GET https://ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/api/cron/monthly-wrapup?secret=<CRON_SECRET>&only=grant@findfitpeople.com&force=1`. (3) On Grant's OK, **full June resend**: same URL **without `only`**, keep `force=1` (audience = active+profile_complete members; honours `preferences.no_monthly_email`). (4) Confirm hero photo choice + that QuickChart/Supabase images load in Gmail on device. CRON_SECRET is Vercel-only — Grant triggers.

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · QUEST ENGINE — STEP 1 of 3: shared task catalog (DB only; live)
Grant's directive: build a quest where the author **picks tasks from a shared library** (referral monthly, high five capped, host meetup, etc.), sets a per-quest amount, and the same task can sit in 2–4 quests. TWO quest shapes confirmed:
- **points_race** (his FIRST quest = "How many points can you collect during July?"): no targets, accumulate points all month, leaderboard by total. Some tasks capped/day (log activity, log food, high five), others uncapped (referrals, meetups).
- **checklist** (existing shape): each task has a target (host ×1, refer ×2, log ×10); quest completes when all targets met.
Both pull from the SAME catalog → step 1 is shared.

**DONE this turn (DB migration `quest_task_catalog_create_and_seed`, applied LIVE):**
- New table `public.quest_task_catalog` (code PK, label, icon, source ['self'|'system'|'partner_scan'], `points` numeric (decimals ok — high_five 0.5), `daily_cap` int null=uncapped, count_event, active, sort_order, timestamps).
- Seeded 13 rows from Grant's points image: daily_login 1/cap1, log_food 1/cap1, log_workout 2/cap1, use_ai_coach 3/cap1, high_five 0.5/cap5, comment 1/uncap, connect_member 5, bring_guest 15, referral_monthly 15, referral_annual 30 (system, uncapped), partner_checkin 8 (partner_scan), attend_meetup 10, host_meetup 30 (system, uncapped).
- ADDITIVE ONLY — not yet read by any code. No frontend change, no build bump. Nothing for Grant to deploy yet.

**EXISTING quest plumbing verified live this turn (reuse, don't rebuild — RULE 5):** tables `quests`/`quest_tasks`(has `rule` jsonb, unused)/`quest_progress`/`quest_task_completions`. Admin UI `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` v3 already authors quests + tasks (`admin_save_quest`→quests, `quest_save_task`/`quest_list_tasks`/`quest_delete_task`, reviews via `quest_pending_completions`/`quest_verify_completion`). Member UI `ffp-quests-core.js` v10 (feed/detail/join/doTask/leaderboard). `member_quest_complete_task` already verifies+awards qr/qr_gps/gps/photo_gps instantly, routes photo→review. GAPS (step 2/3): proof_type 'auto' is a dead end (returns `auto_task`, `rule` jsonb read by nothing); no event hooks; no points ledger/catalog (now creating); `referral`/`partner` proof have no completion branch. Member-create code still in ffp-quests-core (~L832) → remove (Grant: member creation no longer exists).

**STEP 2a DONE (DB migration `quest_engine_step2a_ledger_recorder_evaluator`, applied LIVE + isolation-tested then cleaned up):**
- Widened `points`/`points_awarded`/`points_total` to numeric (high_five 0.5 scores correctly).
- Added `quests.mode` ('checklist' default | 'points_race') + check constraint `quests_mode_chk`.
- New ledger `public.member_action_log` (member_id, event, points_base, meta, action_day, created_at) + indexes — the scoreboard; source of truth for daily caps + points-race totals. action_day = UTC date (TZ refinement later).
- `_quest_capped_count(me,event,from,to,cap)` — counted actions in window, LEAST(per-day,cap), null cap = uncapped.
- `quest_eval_auto(me,event)` — for each live quest in-window with an auto task on that event: auto-joins public quests; points_race → recompute quest_progress.points = Σ over auto tasks of capped_count × task.points; checklist → per matching task, if capped_count ≥ rule.target insert verified completion (award task.points) + recount (completed when all tasks done). Reuses the same award/recount shape as member_quest_complete_task.
- `quest_record_action(me,event,meta)` — catalog lookup; skips insert if already at daily_cap today; else inserts ledger row + calls quest_eval_auto.
- TEST (member=Grant, synthetic quest, then fully deleted): points_race = 38.5 (workouts 3 distinct days×2=6 [cap1 collapsed 5 raw→3], high_five 5 of 8 [cap5]×0.5=2.5, referral 2×15=30); checklist completed (3-day target met, 50 awarded); recorder cap-skip fired. Cleanup verified: 0 test quests, member_action_log 0 rows.
- ADDITIVE; NO hooks into live paths yet; no frontend; no build bump; nothing for Grant to deploy.

**INCOMPLETE / NEXT:**
- STEP 2b (NEXT — touches LIVE action paths, plan-first): wire `quest_record_action` at each source so real actions score. Confirmed source tables exist: activity_logs (log_workout/log activity), food_logs (log_food), meetups+meetup_attendees (host_meetup/attend_meetup), member_connections (connect_member), referrals (referral_monthly/annual). No table yet for high_five / comment / daily_login / use_ai_coach / bring_guest (frontend-emit or add later). Approach to pick: AFTER-INSERT triggers on those tables (can't be forgotten) vs explicit calls in the SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (log_activity, handle_connection, host_meetup, join_meetup, venue_checkin_activity, admin_verify_referral). Map referral_monthly vs referral_annual (referred member's plan term).
- STEP 3 (member-side render): member UI (ffp-quests-core.js) still shows points-race standing / target progress + remove member-create leftover (~L832) — NOT done yet (admin authoring done; member display next).
- Partner-authored quests: later, after Admin operational (Grant).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · MEMBER QUEST UI — points-race screen + breakdown + leaderboard filters (frontend; Grant deploys)
Goes in **Passport > Quests panel** (`assets/ffp-quests-core.js`, loaded as window.Quests). Built this turn:
- **Points-race detail view** (`openTaskDetail`, branch on `d.mode==='points_race'`): hero shows big **points + rank** (no task checklist), "Tracked automatically" hint; the "Tasks" segment is relabelled **"My points"**.
- **"Ways to earn" MODAL** (`openWaysToEarn`/`closeWays`, bottom-sheet overlay `#q-ways-ov`) listing each task with points + cap/target — replaces the inline checklist for races.
- **"Where your points came from"** breakdown (`loadBreakdown` → new RPC `member_quest_points_breakdown(me,quest)`): per action-type, count × points; shown inline in the My-points pane.
- **Leaderboard filters**: added **My region** chip (+ existing Global/My country/My city) and Gender (All/Men/Women). `loadQuestBoard` passes p_region; RPC `quest_leaderboard` got a `p_region` param (appended, default null) + region/gender in output.
- Checklist quests unchanged (still the accordion task checklist + progress bar).
- Supporting RPCs (all additive, DB-LIVE): `member_quest_detail` +`mode` +per-task `activity_type/target/cap/my_progress`; `member_quests_feed` +`mode`; `quest_leaderboard` +region; `member_quest_points_breakdown` NEW.
- VERIFIED live (Grant test quest, then deleted): detail.mode=points_race, my_points=4.0, breakdown=[high_five 4×0.5, log_workout 1×2], leaderboard returns region+gender. `node --check` PASSED on ffp-quests-core.js (970 lines, full parse). NOTE: member-create code (saveCreate/openInvite ~L880-969) still present — Grant said member-create is dead; left in place for now (dormant) to avoid risk, remove in a later pass.
- FILES TO DEPLOY: `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (bumped `?v=10→11`) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (the ?v ref + `FFP_BUILD 496→497`). Device avatar menu should read **Build 497**. NOT visually click-tested (no browser) — logic + RPC-shape verified; confirm on device.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · MEMBER QUEST UI — points-race no targets + "Ways to earn" full-screen (member `?v=11→12`, `FFP_BUILD 497→498`)
- **Points race shows NO targets, only the daily cap** (Grant). `openWaysToEarn` now gates target text on `this._openMode !== 'points_race'` (race tasks carry no target anyway; this is belt-and-suspenders vs a checklist→race switch). Admin builder already hides the Target field + omits rule.target in points_race mode — no change needed there.
- **"Ways to earn points" modal is now FULL-SCREEN + FULL-BLEED** (was a bottom sheet). `.q-ways-ov`/`.q-we-wrap` → `inset:0`, solid `#0a1722`, no rounded sheet; inner list capped ~620px centered. **NEW STANDING CONVENTION added to CLAUDE.md top: member-app modals are full-screen full-bleed (match `#ffp-act-card-ov`).**
- Deploy `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (`?v=12`) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (`FFP_BUILD 498`). Build stamp → **498**. (Shell node --check truncates this file at the mount boundary — false EOF; file ends `};` L970, edits balanced.)

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · LEADERBOARD FILTER — selectable country/region/city (not "My X") (member `?v=14→15`/`FFP_BUILD 501`)
Grant: filter should let you VIEW any country/region/city's leaders, not just your own. Replaced the Global/My-country/My-region/My-city chips with **cascading selects**: Country → Region → City (region select hidden unless the chosen country has regions in the data). New RPC `quest_leaderboard_locations(p_quest)` returns distinct {country,region,city} among participants (points>0). ffp-quests-core: state boardScope→`boardCountry/boardRegion/boardCity`; `boardLoadLocations`/`_distinctLoc`/`_fillLocSelect`/`boardLocChange` build the cascade; loadQuestBoard passes the selected p_country/p_region/p_city; badge counts a location pick. Gender chips unchanged. CSS `.q-flt-sel`. Loads options on first board open. File ends `};` (L1027). Deploy `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=15) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **501**).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · QUEST DETAIL description — 16px + 2-line clamp w/ "Show more" (member `?v=13→14`/`FFP_BUILD 500`)
`ffp-quests-core.js` quest detail (`openTaskDetail`): `.q-d2-desc` 13px→**16px**; added `.q-d2-desc.clamp` (-webkit-line-clamp:2) + a `.q-d2-more` "Show more" button shown ONLY when the text overflows 2 lines (scrollHeight>clientHeight check, 30ms after open). `descMore()` removes the clamp + hides the button. Deploy `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=14) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **500**).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · MONTHLY WRAP-UP email — 1st of each month (backend v135 + DB; Grant deploys Vercel)
Rich monthly wrap-up: improvement vs prior month, per-activity detail, food, who-with, + FEEDBACK ask. Everyone (active→stats; quiet→come-back).
- DB (live): `member_monthly_wrapup(p_me,p_from,p_to)` → activities/minutes/distance/cities, **by_activity** (per activity count/min/km), **food_days/items**, **partners** (confirmed activity_partners names), meetups, new_connections, **prev_activities/prev_distance_km** (improvement). Test Grant June: 51 acts / Running 15×52km / food 13d / partners Hannah+Sunjay / prev 1.
- Backend `index.js` **v135**: `GET /api/cron/monthly-wrapup` (CRON_SECRET; `?only=<id|email>` test; `?force=1` send-all; sends only when UTC date=1; honours `preferences.no_monthly_email`). Descriptive email (improvement line, "What you did" per-activity table, "What you loved most", "Better together"=partners, "Nutrition"=food, social line, CTA) + **"Share your feedback"** CTA → `APP_URL?feedback=1`. Mirrors sunday-summary. Endpoint region verified balanced; file ends `module.exports = app;` (mount truncates node --check — not real).
- `vercel.json`: cron `/api/cron/monthly-wrapup` `0 5 1 * *` (09:00 UAE, 1st).
- DEPLOY: `index.js` + `vercel.json` → Vercel. (Also includes broadcast v134 routing — same deploy.) TEST: `?only=grant@findfitpeople.com&secret=<CRON_SECRET>`. NOTE: feedback CTA `?feedback=1` — wire member app to route it to a feedback form if not already.

## LATEST — 2026-07-01 · QUICK WINS: leaderboard auto-refresh + crew-others-only + photo mandatory (member `?v=16→17`/`FFP_BUILD 508→509`)
- **Leaderboard auto-refresh** (`ffp-quests-core.js` openTaskDetail): self-cleaning `setInterval` (45s) reloads the board while the board pane is visible + tab visible; clears when `#q-board-list` gone (modal closed). Answers Grant's "when do points update" — DB updates per action; open board now ticks up on its own.
- **Support your crew → OTHERS only** (`renderTrendCrew`): filters `support_ops` to drop any `member_id === me`.
- **Log activity: 1 photo mandatory** (`saveLog`): NEW logs blocked until ≥1 photo (edits of old photo-less rows not blocked). `node --check` clean on quests-core.
- Deploy `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=17) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **509**).
- **#41 diagnosis (Grant screenshot):** push "High-five Sunjay from FFP Pro" delivered via the **FFP PROFESSIONAL PWA** (green icon). `push_subscriptions` has NO app column → member pushes reach the Pro-PWA subscription. Fix = app-scope subscriptions (schema + both PWAs + send filter) — bigger, kept as task #41. Coach-nudge title itself (index.js L5065 'High-five '+name) is fine; the "from FFP Pro" is the delivering PWA's identity.
- OPEN quick-ish next: #36 map filter by activity, #40 share-card info. Bigger: #35 pin accuracy, #37 coach richness, #41 push scoping.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · FIX — "Edit activity" did nothing (member `FFP_BUILD 507→508`)
Activity card "Edit activity" button called `window.ffpEditActivity(id)` which was **never defined** → the `&&` short-circuited; the button's leading `ffpCloseActivityCard()` ran so it just bounced back to the passport, no edit. FIX: defined `window.ffpEditActivity(id)` — reads the open card's full row (`window._ffpActCard`, set at L7059) BEFORE closing, falls back to LOGS.find, then calls the existing `openLogModalForEdit(row)` (prefills everything + "Update activity" + delete). Removed the leading `ffpCloseActivityCard()` from the button so the row is still available when the handler reads it. Deploy `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **508**).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · TRENDS — Coach + Crew rotate every 5 min; "On FFP this week" pulse REMOVED (member `FFP_BUILD 506→507`)
Grant: Coach tip + Support-your-crew were static all day; the platform pulse was weak — remove it.
- REMOVED the standalone `#trend-pulse` block + `renderTrendPulse()` + its renderAll call (the "On FFP this week" pulse). `platform_pulse()` RPC left in DB, now UNUSED (harmless; drop later if wanted).
- **Coach Grant tip** (renderTrend): replaced the single deterministic line with a ROTATING `tips[]` (built from the member's real data: streak/this-vs-last-week/top activity/total/cities + evergreen nudges), indexed by `window._ffpCoachIdx`.
- **Support your crew** (renderTrendCrew): now shows a rotating window of up to 3 support_ops (indexed by `window._ffpCrewIdx`) instead of all/static.
- **5-min refresh interval** added (next to the 60s notifications interval): when the passport is visible, increments both indices + re-renders renderTrend + renderTrendCrew → both visibly change every 5 minutes.
- DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **507**).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · TRENDS — live platform pulse (member `FFP_BUILD 504→505`)
Grant: Trends card "said the same thing all day" — it was 100% the member's OWN static LOGS (total/streak/this-vs-last-week/fixed Coach tip). Added a LIVE community pulse so it stays current + draws people back.
- New RPC `platform_pulse()` (DB-live, SECURITY DEFINER stable): activities_today, activities_week, active_members_week, top_activity(+count) trending, meetups_week, new_members_week. (Live test: 10 today / 48 week / 9 active / Walking×12 / 2 meetups / 3 new.)
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html`: new `#trend-pulse` block in the Trends card + `renderTrendPulse()` (chips: activities this week, members active, trending activity, meet-ups coming up, new members + "N logged today — and counting"). Called at end of `renderTrend()` → refreshes every passport open, so numbers move through the day. Note: lives inside `#trend-card` which hides when the member has zero personal logs (new members won't see it until they log — acceptable; revisit if Grant wants it always-on).
- DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **505**). DB pulse RPC already live.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · NOTIFICATION LEAK fix — provider/pro notifs no longer hit the member Passport (DB live)
Grant: "broadcasts/notifications from FFP Pro on the Passport — NEVER should happen." ROOT CAUSE: `notifications_set_scope` trigger only mapped `*professional-dashboard*` links → 'professional'; **everything else (incl. `*provider-dashboard*` links AND link-less broadcasts) defaulted to 'member'** → the member bell (GET /api/notifications/:id filters scope='member') showed provider booking alerts + any non-pro-linked broadcast. FIX (migration `notifications_scope_harden_provider_pro`, DB-live): trigger now also maps `*provider-dashboard*` → 'provider'; re-tagged existing leaked rows (provider-link 'member'→'provider', pro-link→'professional'). No deploy.
- "Mike Bourne from FFP Pro" — Mike's role = **member** (verified). His high-five/activity notifs are legit member-connection pings, not Pro. If a UI label said "FFP Pro", that's a separate branding issue — need Grant to point to the exact element.
- **BROADCAST AUDIENCE ROUTING — BUILT (Grant deploys backend + admin):** Audiences = Members(Passport) / Professionals(FFP Pro) / Providers(Partners) / FFP Booking / Everyone (+ keep member tier/country/gender segment, member app only).
  - Backend `index.js` **v134**: `/api/admin/broadcast` accepts `app`; stamps `notifications.scope` EXPLICITLY per app ('member'|'professional'|'provider'|'booking'; 'all' = one row per scope). Member segment → member_ids (member app only). Phone push only when members in scope. GET `/api/notifications/:id` scope param generalised to member|professional|provider|booking. Parses clean, ends `module.exports = app;`. → **DEPLOY to Vercel.**
  - Admin `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`: new **"Send to"** select (#bc-app) + `onAppChange()` hides the member-segment field unless app=member; `send()` posts `app`. Footer **v53**. → DEPLOY (Netlify).
  - NOTE: each app shows its scope IF its bell requests it — member (default) + pro (?scope=professional, v117) already do; **provider + FFP Booking bells must call `/api/notifications/:id?scope=provider|booking`** to display these (wire in those apps if not already).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · ADMIN quest SAVE banner fix + Vanshita phantom-points cleanup (admin `v=64→65`, footer `v51→52`)
- **Save feedback fix (Grant: "Save does nothing"):** the shared `#toast` is `z-index:200`, BELOW the full-screen quest modal (`z-index:100000`) → invisible on save (and it's bottom + yellow). Rewrote the admin-quests loader's `toast(m,k)` to render its OWN banner: fixed TOP-center, `z-index:100010` (above the modal), **green (success) / red (error) / blue (info)**, material icon, auto-dismiss 2.8s, slide-in keyframe `aqFlashIn`. Self-contained (doesn't touch the shared showToast). Deploy `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (build **v52**).
- **Vanshita Phulpagar = real member, phantom 30 cleaned:** my earlier check-in TEST used her as the test meetup host; the attendee's check-in trigger credited her host_meetup, which ALSO scored the REAL Global Ambassador quest (eval hits ALL live quests). Test cleanup deleted the test quest's progress but missed her Global Ambassador row. Deleted GA progress + recomputed → she's gone. **LESSON: a test that calls quest_track for a real member pollutes ALL live quests — use a throwaway member or non-live quest for trigger tests.**
- **Global Ambassador start date now 20:00 tonight (Grant set it):** all backfilled June history is now BEFORE the start → excluded; board starts EMPTY and fills from 8pm onward. Grant's call: **keep it fresh** (clean launch from 0). No change made.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · UPCOMING QUEST teasers ("Coming soon") (member quests-core `?v=15→16`/`FFP_BUILD 503→504`)
Grant: tease an upcoming quest on the passport before it's live, to build hype. MODEL (no new admin control): **publish a quest with a FUTURE start date → it's an "upcoming" teaser** (draft=hidden; live+future start=teaser; live+started=active). Engine already only scores inside [active_from, active_to].
- DB (live): `member_quests_feed` adds an **`upcoming`** group (owner_type ffp, public, status live, active_from > now()) with starts_at; major/minor stay active-only (active_from <= now()). `member_quest_detail` adds `starts_at`/`ends_at`.
- `ffp-quests-core.js`: state `upcoming:[]` + load it; renderAll shows a **"Coming soon"** section at the TOP (above My quests) via new `upcomingCard()` (hero teaser: cover, "Starts X" pill, day-countdown, title, desc, "tap to preview"). `openTaskDetail` upcoming-aware: `isUpcoming = starts_at > now()` → shows a **"Starts X · N days to go"** banner instead of points/rank; hides leaderboard tab + board + join CTA; shows ways-to-earn / task list as a read-only PREVIEW (no breakdown, nothing scores yet). CSS `.q-up*` + `.q-up-banner`. Visual-only (no notify-me, per Grant). Placement: Quests panel top (per Grant).
- Validated: file ends `};` (L1063); shell node --check truncates mid-file (mount) — not a real error.
- DEPLOY: `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=16) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **504**). To tease the July quest: set its start date in the future + Publish.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · MEETUP CHECK-IN front end built (QR + GPS) (checkin loader `?v=10→11`, meet-move via `FFP_BUILD 502→503`)
Reused the existing check-in infra (RULE 5) — no new scanner/QR libs.
- **Attendee (`ffp-member-checkin-loader.js`):** `parseMeetup()` reads `?meetup=<id>&mc=<token>` (or `ffpmeetup:<id>:<token>`); the existing `Html5Qrcode` scanner ("Scan QR" on Passport) now also recognises a meetup QR → `meetupCheckin(id,code)` → GPS → `meetup_check_in` RPC → friendly result (handles bad_code/window_closed/too_far/need_location). `boot()` resumes a phone-camera scan landing as `?meetup=&mc=` (stash + resume-after-login, like venue/pro). Registered `FFPCheckin._meetup`.
- **Host (`assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js`):** host-only **"Show check-in QR"** button injected into `openMeetupDetail` (next to requests/cancel). `MeetMove.showCheckinQR(id)` fetches `meetups.checkin_token`, renders a QR (the `QRCode` qrcodejs global already loaded) of the check-in URL + shows the code as a scan fallback.
- Both files `node --check` clean. DB (`meetup_check_in` + `checkin_token`) already live from prior turn.
- DEPLOY: `ffp-member-checkin-loader.js` (?v=11) + `assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **503**). Meetup host/attend points now fully earnable end-to-end.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · "View Passport" → match-detail page (incl. connections) (member conn-core `?v=359→360`/`FFP_BUILD 502`)
Grant: "View Passport" should open the rich **match-detail** page (the `openMemberDetail` screen with % match + "Why you match"), NOT the simpler `openPerson` view — and keep the % match for existing connections (updates as skills change + builds trust).
- KEY: `get_match_pool` already returns connected members (has conn_status) BUT only those sharing city/sport (≤80) → a connection sharing neither isn't in the pool. So added **`get_match_one(p_me,p_other)`** RPC (DB live) — same row shape as the pool for ONE member (no city/sport filter) + bio + verified.
- `ffp-connections-core.js`: extracted `_buildMatchObj(r)` (builds the match object — %, matchSports, matchOther, sports, bio, verified — from a raw row); `openMemberDetail` now **async**: if the member isn't in `this.matches`, fetch `get_match_one` → `_buildMatchObj` → render (so connections work). `CollectionView.openPerson` now **delegates to `MeetMove.openMemberDetail`** (old simple view kept as fallback if MeetMove absent). NOTE tech-debt: `_buildMatchObj` duplicates loadMatches' inline mapping (kept loadMatches untouched to avoid regression) — consolidate later.
- Validated: `node --check` clean (978 lines). Deploy `assets/ffp-connections-core.js` (?v=360) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (build **502**).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · Global Ambassador audit: stale board fixed + new points + host-confirmation gap (DB live)
- **Stale leaderboard FIXED:** quest_progress for `cf0a0f6d…` was inflated (pre-June-trim data never recomputed; Sunjay showed 200 vs true 164). Deleted quest_progress + `quest_recompute_all` → board now matches the true scoreboard.
- **"New numbers":** bumped this quest's task points to current catalog (log_workout 3→5, high_five 1→2, log_food 1→5; others already matched) + `_quest_recount` + recompute. New board: Grant 657, Sunjay 195, Hannah 52, Eilsel 36, Dylan 30, Alastair 30, Phil 30, Mike 24, Laura 15, Ayman 15, Bazz 7.
- **host/attend now CONFIRMED-ATTENDANCE based** (Grant chose: attendee check-in; + "require real attendance now"). Migrations `quest_host_meetup_confirmed_by_attendance` then `quest_meetup_checkin_attendance`: `trg_quest_meetup_attend` fires on `meetup_attendees.status='attended'` (insert OR update) → attend_meetup for the attendee + host_meetup for the host (once, first confirmed attendee). New RPC `meetup_check_in(p_me,p_meetup)` sets status='attended' (inserts row if no prior RSVP) → triggers scoring. (`meetup_attendees.status` had no check constraint — 'attended' allowed.) Cleared ALL host_meetup+attend_meetup ledger rows (were RSVP-based) → re-earn via check-in. Recomputed: Dylan & Phil dropped off (unconfirmed hosts). Board now Grant 617, Sunjay 175, Hannah 52, Eilsel 36, Alastair 30, Mike 24, Ayman 15, Laura 15, Bazz 7.
- **MEETUP CHECK-IN = QR + GPS + window** (Grant chose). Migration `meetup_checkin_qr_gps`: `meetups.checkin_token` (auto-gen short code, host shows as QR; backfilled all). `meetup_check_in(p_me,p_meetup,p_code,p_lat,p_lng)` validates: code==token, time in [meets_at−30min, meets_at+3h], GPS within 250m of meetup lat/lng (via ffp_haversine_m; skipped only if meetup has no coords) → sets status='attended' (inserts row if no RSVP) → trigger scores. (Dropped the old 2-arg meetup_check_in to avoid an overload — the leaderboard lesson.) TESTED: attendee 'attended' → attendee +20 attend_meetup, host +30 host_meetup (confirmed). Test data cleaned.
- **NEXT (frontend, not built):** (a) Host: "Show check-in QR" on their meetup (renders checkin_token as QR). (b) Attendee: "Scan to check in" → scan host QR + geolocation → `meetup_check_in(code,lat,lng)`. Reuse the app's existing QR scanner (quest qr proof) if present. Until shipped, host/attend score 0 (intended).
- STILL PENDING: "View Passport" → match-detail wiring (needs a per-pair match RPC since match pool excludes connections).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · FIX — leaderboard empty (duplicate quest_leaderboard overload) — DB live
Bug I introduced: adding `p_region` to `quest_leaderboard` via CREATE OR REPLACE **changed the arg list → created a SECOND overload** (6-arg + 7-arg both existed). The member call became ambiguous (`function ... is not unique`) → board failed/empty. FIX: `drop function public.quest_leaderboard(uuid,integer,text,text,text,text)` (the old 6-arg). Only the 7-arg (region-aware) remains; call now returns all 11 members for "Global Ambassador" (Grant 511 … Bazz 7). DB-only, live, no deploy — just reopen the quest.
**LESSON (process):** when changing a function's PARAMETER LIST, `DROP` the old signature first — CREATE OR REPLACE only replaces an identical signature, otherwise you get a silent overload + ambiguity. Verify with `pg_get_function_identity_arguments` after.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · BACKFILL history + JOIN MODE + My Quests + race tab order (admin `v=64`/`v51`, member `?v=12→13`/`FFP_BUILD 499`; DB live)
**BACKFILL (one-time, DB live):** rebuilt `member_action_log` from source tables (migration `quest_backfill_member_action_log_from_sources`), then trimmed to **from 2026-06-01** (Grant). Now **259 rows / 12 members, Jun 2–30**: log_workout 92, log_food 56, high_five 56, connect_member 32, activity_with_friend 10, social_share 6, referral_monthly 5, host_meetup 4, attend_meetup 4. Caps applied at count-time (not pre-capped). Going forward, triggers add new rows (no dupes — backfill is one-time).
**RECOMPUTE:** `quest_recompute_all(p_quest)` (migration `quest_join_mode_and_recompute_all`) — recomputes standings for every member with matching history in the window. TEST (June-1 dated points_race, 4 tasks): Grant 266, Sunjay 170, Hannah 47… then test quest deleted, ledger kept (259). So **back-dating = set start date in past + publish → standings auto-fill** (admin `setStatus('live')` now calls quest_recompute_all).
**JOIN MODE:** `quests.join_mode` ('auto' default | 'opt_in') + check constraint. `quest_eval_auto` now only auto-joins when join_mode='auto'; opt_in quests score ONLY members who joined (via `member_quest_join`). `member_quest_detail` exposes `join_mode`.
**ADMIN (ffp-admin-quests-loader.js):** new "Who takes part" select (Everyone auto / Members tap Join) → saves join_mode; recompute-on-publish. File ends `})();`.
**MEMBER (ffp-quests-core.js):** (1) points-race detail → **Leaderboard is the DEFAULT tab on the LEFT, "My points" on the right** (Grant); board loads on open. (2) **Join button** (`joinQuest` → member_quest_join → reopen) shown when join_mode='opt_in' & not joined. (3) **"My quests"** section in renderAll = joined FFP quests + partner quests, with "More quests" below to browse. CSS `.q-join-cta`. File ends `};` (L990). Shell node --check truncates mid-file (mount) — false EOF; verified via file tools.
DEPLOY: `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (admin build **v51**), `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (member build **499**).

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · CATALOG POINTS reset + per-task CAP override + cleaner task list (admin `v=63→64`, footer `v50→51`; DB live)
- **Catalog default points (Grant's screenshot):** attend_meetup 10→20, log_workout(Log an Activity) 2→5, log_food 1→5, high_five 0.5→2, activity_with_friend 5→10, referral_monthly 15→20 (host 30, social 5, referral_annual 30, use_ai_coach 1, connect 5 unchanged). Existing tasks keep their own stored points; this is the auto-fill default for new picks.
- **Per-task CAP override:** new **Cap / day** field in the task builder (`qt-cap`), prefilled from catalog `daily_cap`, blank = no cap. Saved into `quest_tasks.rule.cap`. Scorer now uses effective cap = `case when rule ? 'cap' then nullif(rule->>'cap','')::int else catalog.daily_cap end` — updated in `quest_eval_auto`, `member_quest_points_breakdown`, `member_quest_detail` (migration `quest_per_task_cap_override`). TEST: high_five task cap=2 (catalog 5) + 5 actions → counted 2 ×2pts = 4. ✓ Legacy tasks w/o rule.cap fall back to catalog.
- **Task list subtitle cleaned (Grant: "no points/cap in title"):** library tasks now show just the green "library" badge — removed the repeated label + target + cap text (points already shown on the right). qtCatChange prefills cap (guarded so it doesn't clobber during edit); editTask sets cap from rule.cap or catalog; cancelTaskEdit resets it.
- Files: `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (cache-bust `v=64`, footer **v51**). File ends `})();` L547.
- OPEN (Grant qs this turn, answered in chat, NOT built): (1) **back-dating points** — set a quest start date in the past → counts everything already in `member_action_log`; for history BEFORE the engine went live, can backfill the ledger from source tables (activity_logs, activity_likes, social_shares, workout_logs, meetups, member_connections, referrals). (2) **Join model** — auto-join (points race, already auto-joins on first action) vs opt-in (member taps Join) → needs a **"My Quests"** view + gating scoring to joined for opt-in quests. Awaiting Grant's go.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · CATALOG LABEL — "Log a workout" → "Log an Activity" (DB only; live)
`quest_task_catalog`: code `log_workout` label → **"Log an Activity"** (Grant). Code/event UNCHANGED (`log_workout`), so all triggers/RPCs/scoring untouched — display-only. Live in admin picker + member ways-to-earn + breakdown (all read catalog live). No deploy.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · ADMIN QUEST FORM — tabbed (Details | Tasks) + readability pass (frontend; Grant deploys)
`ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` (Grant: "upload screen really hard to read" + wants tabs). Changes:
- **Tabs**: form split into `#qf-pane-details` (Title…Hero) and `#qf-pane-tasks` (the missions builder), with a sticky `.qf-tabs` bar [Details | Tasks] + `formTab(which)` (registered on window.AdminQuests). New quest → after Save it auto-lands on the **Tasks** tab. Empty-state on Tasks for an unsaved quest = a friendly dashed card ("Save the quest details first…").
- **Readability**: labels 11px-uppercase-grey → **12.5px, #c3d0db, not uppercase**; inputs bg #08131f/border #1a2f44 → **#0c1a28/#2c4459**, text #e8eef4→**#f1f6fa**, **15px**, focus ring #2ba8e0; placeholders #6d8090; **`color-scheme:dark`** on date/select so native pickers are legible (the date fields were the worst offenders).
- Caught+fixed a CSS typo mid-edit (`#2c4considerable` → `#2c4459`).
- Validated by file tools (ends `})();` L535); shell node --check unreliable here — the bash mount serves a TRUNCATED copy of THIS file (caches ~L491, errors at "cons"/`const`), NOT a real parse error. Trust Read/Edit.
- NO re-bump — rides the SAME undeployed admin change (cache-bust `v=63`, footer `v50`). Deploy `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` → footer build v50.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · ADMIN QUEST BUILDER — Start/End date fields added (frontend; Grant deploys)
`ffp-admin-quests-loader.js`: added **Start date + End date** inputs (`q-start`/`q-end`, type=date) on the quest details form, after Quest type. `save()` writes `active_from` (start 00:00:00) + `active_to` (end 23:59:59), validates end>=start, and only overwrites active_from when a start is set (blank start on new quest → defaults now()). `setStatus()` NO LONGER overwrites active_from on publish (was resetting it to now()) — the date fields are the source of truth, so a future-dated quest stays scheduled. Edit form prefills both from active_from/active_to (slice(0,10)). The member feed/detail already filter by active_from/active_to (window), and the scorer counts only within [active_from, active_to]. Validated: file ends `})();` (L511); shell node --check falsely truncates at L496 (mount issue) — trust file tools. NO re-bump needed — still in the SAME undeployed change as step 3 (cache-bust `v=63`, footer `v50`); deploying `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` now also ships the date fields.

## LATEST — 2026-06-30 · QUEST ENGINE — "Social share" added + wired (DB only; live)
New library task `social_share` (label "Social share", source self, **5 points, daily_cap 3**, sort 65). Capture already existed: `log_social_share(member,kind,platform)` → inserts `social_shares` (deduped 1/kind/day). Migration `quest_wire_social_share`: AFTER-INSERT trigger on `social_shares` → `quest_track(member_id,'social_share')`. Counts any share kind (activity/passport/app), cap 3/day. TEST: 4 shares → capped 3 → 15 pts; test rows deleted.
**NOTE (live proof):** while testing, the production `high_five` hook captured REAL members high-fiving (2 members, ledger rows in `member_action_log` at 05:55–05:56Z) — the engine is live and scoring real users. The scoreboard `member_action_log` accumulates catalog actions even with NO live quest yet (by design — it's the foundation + future global score). DO NOT delete real ledger rows when cleaning tests (filter by the test member/marker only).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · QUEST ENGINE — "Activity with a friend" added + wired (DB only; live)
New library task `activity_with_friend` (label "Activity with a friend", source system, **points 10 = my default, Grant to confirm**, daily_cap NULL/uncapped). Migration `quest_add_and_wire_activity_with_friend`: AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE trigger on `activity_partners` → when status becomes 'confirmed' (via `activity_partner_respond(p_me,p_id,true)`), awards BOTH `tagged_by` (logger) AND `partner_member_id` (the friend who confirmed). Fires once on the transition, exception-safe. TEST (Grant tags a friend on a real activity_log → confirmed): both scored 10; all test rows (activity_partners/activity_log/quest/ledger for both members) deleted, 0 left.
SETTLED (Grant): activity_with_friend = **5 points, daily_cap 2** (each participant max 2/day). Applied to quest_task_catalog.
**partner_checkin: ON HOLD — no partners onboarded yet** (facility check-in; nothing to capture/test until partners exist; also needs venue check-ins tagged to avoid double-count with log_workout). **bring_guest: still no mechanism** (build capture or drop).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · QUEST ENGINE — referral_monthly/annual wired (DB only; live)
Plan term lives in **`members.plan`** ('monthly' | 'annual' | null). Migration `quest_wire_referral_by_plan_term`:
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE trigger on `referrals` → when status becomes 'paid' (the admin_verify_referral / webhook path),
look up `members.plan` of `referred_member_id` → award the **referrer** `referral_annual` (plan='annual') else `referral_monthly`
(monthly/null fallback). Uncapped, exception-safe, fires once on the transition. TEST (Grant referrer, one annual + one
monthly referred member, flipped pending→paid): scored 30 + 15 = 45, routed correctly by plan; all test rows deleted (0 left).
REMAINING HELD: partner_checkin (tag venue check-ins to avoid double-count), bring_guest (no mechanism — build or drop).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · QUEST ENGINE — high_five + use_ai_coach wired (DB only; live)
Both DB-live, exception-safe, real-action tested then cleaned (0 rows left). Nothing for Grant to deploy.
- **high_five** (migration `quest_wire_high_five_in_like`): added `perform quest_track(p_me,'high_five',…)` INSIDE `member_like_activity`, on the like-ADD branch and ONLY when `a.member_id <> p_me` (encouraging someone else, not self; un-like does not fire). Per-day cap 5 enforced by the scorer.
- **use_ai_coach** = "doing the AI-Coach workout, min 10 minutes" (Grant). AI-Coach guided runner saves every completed session to `workout_logs` (member_id, duration_sec) via `logWorkoutSession()` (both Done + Save-to-Passport). Migration `quest_wire_use_ai_coach_workout_10min`: AFTER-INSERT trigger on `workout_logs` → if `duration_sec >= 600` → `quest_track(member_id,'use_ai_coach')`. (Save-to-Passport ALSO opens Log Activity → a normal manual activity_log → also fires log_workout; intended — did a workout AND used the coach.)
- TEST (Grant, live points_race quest): workout_logs 700s scored, 300s did NOT; 7 high-fives capped to 5 → 5×0.5=2.5; +use_ai_coach 1 → total 3.5. All test rows deleted (workout_logs/quest/progress/ledger = 0).
- STILL HELD: referral_monthly/annual (need plan-term signal), partner_checkin (tag venue check-ins to avoid double-count), bring_guest (no mechanism — build capture or drop).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · QUEST ENGINE — STEP 2b: real actions wired to scorer (DB only; live) + catalog edits
**Catalog edits (Grant, migration `quest_catalog_remove_login_comment_aicoach1`, LIVE):** removed `daily_login` + `comment` (don't exist as actions); `use_ai_coach` points 3→1. Library now 11 tasks.
**Bring a guest:** NO mechanism exists — searched every column for 'guest', nothing. Not a tracked action. Held; needs a capture point built (e.g. +guest on meetup attendance) or drop it. Pending Grant.
**STEP 2b WIRED (migration `quest_engine_step2b_action_hooks`, LIVE + real-action tested then cleaned):**
- `quest_track(me,event,meta)` — exception-safe wrapper (a scoring error returns null, NEVER aborts the originating insert). All trigger fns also `exception when others then return NEW`.
- AFTER-INSERT triggers: `activity_logs` (source='manual' only → `log_workout`; excludes whoop/coach), `food_logs` (`log_food`), `meetups` (`host_meetup` on host_member_id), `meetup_attendees` (`attend_meetup` on member_id). AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE on `member_connections` → `connect_member` for BOTH requester+addressee when status becomes 'accepted' (guarded so it fires once).
- TEST (real rows for Grant on a live points_race quest): inserted a manual activity_log + a hosted meetup → triggers auto-scored points=32 (workout 2 + host 30). Then DELETED the test activity_log/meetup/quest/progress/ledger — verified 0 left everywhere.
- DB-LIVE; no frontend; nothing for Grant to deploy for 2b.
**HELD (not wired — reason each):**
- `referral_monthly`/`referral_annual`: referrals table has NO plan-term signal (reward_aed = money, not term); can't tell monthly vs annual. Need Grant: where is the referred member's plan term recorded? Then wire on status→'paid' (admin_verify_referral) routing to the right event.
- `partner_checkin`: venue_checkin_activity writes activity_logs — need its rows tagged (source='venue' or a direct quest_track call) so they don't double-count as log_workout. Confirm before wiring.
- `high_five`, `use_ai_coach`: not written to any table today → nothing to detect. Need a capture point (a row/RPC) when the action happens.
NEXT: member-side render (ffp-quests-core points-race standing / target progress + remove member-create leftover). Partner-authored quests later.

**STEP 3 (ADMIN BUILDER) DONE this turn — Grant to DEPLOY 2 files:**
- `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` (header v3): task builder now PICKS from `quest_task_catalog` (dropdown lists each lib task with points·source·cap) instead of free-typing. Selecting a lib task → proof_type='auto', auto-fills points (editable, step 0.5), auto-fills title, and (checklist mode only) shows a **Target ×N** field; saves `rule={activity_type, target?}`. "— Custom (venue/QR/photo) —" option preserves the OLD proof/verifier/venue/GPS builder unchanged (reuse, not replace). New `q-mode` selector on quest details (checklist | points_race) → saved to `quests.mode`; `modeChange()` shows a hint + toggles the Target field; list card shows the mode. New fns: currentMode, catByCode, qtCatChange, modeChange (+ registered on window.AdminQuests). fetchAll loads the catalog. Validated: node --check OK, ends `})();`.
- `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`: lazy-loader cache-bust `v=62→63` (L2590, busts the quests loader); footer `build v49→v50` (L1534).
- DB patch (LIVE): `quest_save_task` points cast `::int→::numeric` (migration `quest_save_task_points_numeric`) — REQUIRED so 0.5-pt tasks save (the step-2a numeric widening exposed it). Tested via RPC: high_five 0.5 + referral 15 → points_total 15.5, rule persisted, mode persisted; test rows deleted.
- DEPLOY: commit `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`. Admin footer should read **build v50**. DB already live. After deploy: open Admin → Quests → New, pick "Points race", add tasks from the library (high five capped, referral monthly, host meetup…), publish. NOTE: tasks won't SCORE until step 2b hooks are wired (the July quest can be fully authored now; scoring goes live with 2b).
⚠️ COMMIT FFP-MASTER.md too (repo sync wipes local-only files).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · WORLD MAP fixes — scope filter to own activity + initial pin offset (member `FFP_BUILD 495→496`)
JourneyMap (member dashboard):
1. FILTER SCOPE — the "Pick a passport" lens (`renderPassportPicker`, L3142) listed ALL `getPassports()` (every category).
   Now it filters to passports the member has ACTUALLY logged: builds `have{}` from `passportForLog(l)` over `LOGS`, shows only those + "All".
   (Country/City dropdowns were already scoped — `render()` builds them from `logsInRange(true)`, the member's logged cities.)
2. INITIAL PIN OFFSET — pins drew in the WRONG screen position and only snapped right after a tap. Cause: the `#ffp-jmap`
   container isn't final-sized at the 250ms init render (splash overlay + mobile layout settle) → Leaflet's pixel origin is stale →
   markers offset until a manual pan re-projects them. FIX (`init()`): added `map.invalidateSize(); render();` on `window 'load'` + a
   1200ms safety retry (idempotent) so the map re-fixes size + re-places pins once layout has settled — no tap needed.
VERIFIED: both edits present (L3157 picker filter, L3489 load trigger), FFP_BUILD 496, file ends `</body></html>` (L8513).
DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (496, Netlify). NOTE: pin-timing fix is a layout-settle heuristic — confirm on device; if pins still
offset on first paint, next step is an IntersectionObserver on the panel becoming visible.

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · PASSPORT HOME — "My activity" grid replaces Top Activities + Top Places (member `FFP_BUILD 493→494`)
Grant: members want their OWN grid on the Passport panel, under the world map. REMOVED the "Top Activities" (#activities-list) and
"Top Places" (#venues-list) cards (HTML); ADDED a "My activity" card (#my-activity-grid) in their place (last sections, under the map).
NEW `renderMyGrid(logs)` + `myActivityTile(a)` → the member's own activities as a 3-wide Instagram grid (newest first; cover photo or
activity-icon tile; multi-photo badge; activity + km/min · date; tap → ffpViewSharedActivity). Uses the same filtered `logs` (passport
lens + map location) the old cards used. `renderAll` now calls `renderMyGrid(logs)` instead of renderActivities/renderVenues (those two
functions remain defined but UNCALLED — harmless dead code). ⚠️ Boot-safety: `setupViewAll()` referenced the removed view-all buttons
(`.addEventListener` on null → throw at boot) — NULL-GUARDED it. VERIFIED: renderMyGrid in renderAll (L3206), card at L618/621, FFP_BUILD 494,
file ends `</body></html>`. 
PHOTO FIX (`FFP_BUILD 494→495`): grid showed icons not photos — `loadJourneyLogs` built each LOGS entry WITHOUT `photo_url`/`photos`
(also no `distance_km`/`logged_at`), though the API returns them. Added those 4 fields to BOTH the main push (L6888) and the
tagged-in/partner push (L6908). Grid now uses the real cover photo + km·date. (Also why the OLD Top Activities/Recent never showed photos.)
DEPLOY (final): `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (495, Netlify).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · CONNECTIONS "Latest activity" → Instagram grid + "All" toggle (member `FFP_BUILD 491→492`, feed loader `?v=333→334`)
Connections feed: the circle row now starts with an "All" cell (default-selected). Behaviour:
- "All" → hides the per-person header ("[Name]'s Passport" + "[Name]'s journey this week") and shows a 3-WIDE Instagram-style grid
  of the member's CONNECTIONS' latest SHARED activities, newest first. (Grant: "All = from THEIR connections, not everyone on the platform.")
  Tile = cover photo (photo_url or photos[0]) + name·activity overlay; multi-photo badge; Option B = no-photo activities show an activity-icon
  tile (nothing hidden). Tap → ffpViewSharedActivity (existing). Works with zero connections (empty grid + add-connections hint).
- Tapping a connection circle → unchanged per-person view (passport + journey + their activities).
- NEW RPC `member_latest_activities(p_me, p_limit)` (SECURITY DEFINER, assert_member_self): shared activity_logs WHERE member_id ∈ the
  member's accepted member_connections, joined to members for name/photo, newest first, cap 200. (74 shared activities live, 56 with photos.)
- FILES: `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` (All cell + renderGlobalGrid + gridTile + selectPerson branch + copy) and
  `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (loader ?v=334, FFP_BUILD 492). VERIFIED: `node --check` feed loader OK; dashboard ends `</body></html>` (L8494).
DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (492) + `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` (Netlify). DB live.
UPDATE (`FFP_BUILD 492→493`, feed loader `?v=334→335`): the PER-PERSON view now also uses the 3-wide grid (was a horizontal slider).
`gridTile(a, showName)` generalised — showName=true (All view: name + activity) / false (a person's own grid: activity + km/min · date).
`renderActivities` swapped its `.cf-acts` slider for the grid; `renderGlobalGrid` passes true. `actCard` now unused (harmless). Per-person
view keeps its passport header + journey-this-week above the grid. VERIFIED via file tool (shell truncates the loader at L364): gridTile closes
(L288), file ends `})();` (L379). DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (493) + `assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` (?v=335).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · LOG ACTIVITY FROM A SCREENSHOT/PHOTO (member `FFP_BUILD 489→490`, backend `v132→v133`)
Reused existing infra (the AI parser, the photo downscaler, the log-form fill) — model is Claude Haiku 4.5 (vision-capable).
- BACKEND `index.js` v133: `/api/ai/parse` now accepts `image` (base64 data URL). When present it sends a Claude VISION message
  (image block + instruction) instead of plain text and returns the SAME JSON shape (activity/duration/distance/calories/HR/steps/
  zones/date/time/location/notes). `text` is now optional when an image is given; 9MB base64 cap → 413. Kind-aware (also handles food images).
- FRONTEND `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (490): extracted the form-fill into `_logFillFromAI(a)` (now used by both paths); added
  `logAIParsePhoto(input)` (ffpDownscaleImage → POST {kind:'activity', image} → fill) + a "Scan a screenshot" button (#log-scan-btn)
  and hidden file input (#log-scan-file) in the Log Activity modal, under the existing "Describe it" box. Hint lists Strava/Garmin/Apple/WHOOP/treadmill.
FLOW: member taps Scan → picks a screenshot of a workout summary → downscaled → Claude reads the numbers → fields pre-fill → member confirms + saves.
BUGFIX (build 490→491): the scan used `ffpDownscaleImage`, which CENTER-CROPS to a 480² SQUARE (it's the avatar downscaler) — a tall
screenshot got cropped to a tiny middle square (title + key numbers cropped out, low-res) → Claude couldn't read it. Added
`ffpScanDownscale` (fit WHOLE image inside 1536px, aspect kept, NO crop, q0.85) and pointed the scan at it. Also: null-guard if the
downscale fails, the failure toast now SHOWS the backend's real error ("Scan error <status> — <detail>") instead of a generic
message, and the console logs the sent image size — so any future failure reports its real cause (no guessing). The console-observed
`400` from /api/ai/parse = "text or image required" (the only 400 in v133) → image wasn't reaching the parser; the surfaced message
("text required" = OLD backend code vs "text or image required" = v133) now disambiguates on the next test.
DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (491, Netlify) + `index.js` (v133, Vercel). VERIFIED: dashboard gate script closes (L8492), new symbols present.
STATUS: ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING on device 2026-06-29 once `index.js` v133 was deployed to Vercel. (The 400 `text required` was the old v132 backend; v133 reads the image. Root cause of the earlier "couldn't read" was BOTH the avatar square-crop downscaler (fixed → ffpScanDownscale) AND the un-deployed backend.)

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · OPEN-FLASH FIX — smooth brand canvas on both apps (member `FFP_BUILD 489`, `PRO_BUILD 89→90`)
App-open colour flash: Passport = blue→WHITE→blue; Professional = WHITE→green. Cause: the canvas (`html`) had no
background set inline, so during the render-blocking CSS load the screen was browser-default WHITE before the body painted.
(Passport was made worse by Module 1 — body bg moved into the external `ffp-member.css`, which loads a beat after the HTML.)
FIX (first-paint inline bg in each `<head>`, before any external CSS):
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html` L49: `<style>html,body{background:#081420;margin:0;}</style>` (matches the #ffp-splash navy). Rides on un-deployed build 489.
- `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` L75: added `background:#0a3e44;` to the `html,body` rule (matches #pro-splash + .gate teal). PRO_BUILD 89→90.
Now the canvas is brand-colour from frame 1 → splash (same colour) → app: no white gap.
NOTE (minor, not changed): the `ffp-member.css` <link> is still `?v=483` while FFP_BUILD=489 — cache-bust drift (CSS content unchanged since Module 1, so functionally fine; bump if ffp-member.css is ever edited).
DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (489) + `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (PRO_BUILD 90).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · "VIEW PASSPORT" → rich member detail + real BIO field (member `FFP_BUILD 488→489`)
Grant picked the match-deck detail layout (#3) for the Connections "View passport" link, and asked to add a REAL bio
(it was synthesised, never stored — members had no bio column). Built end-to-end:
- DB migration `add_member_bio_and_enrich_members_cards` (LIVE): `members.bio` text column; `members_cards` RPC now also returns
  `bio, nationality, verified, meetups_hosted` (count of non-cancelled hosted meetups).
- PROFILE EDITOR (`ffp-member-profile.js` ?v→489): added `data.bio`, an "About me" textarea (loads `d.bio`, saves via autoSave),
  and `bio` in the save payload. Dashboard `init()` hydrate now maps `m.bio`. (Backend PUT already accepted `bio` — no change.)
- CONNECTION DETAIL (`ffp-connections-core.js` ?v=358→359): rewrote `CollectionView.openPerson` (what "View passport"/openCard opens)
  from the flippable-card modal → the #3-style profile: avatar, name + verified tick, city · gender · nationality, member-since, BIO,
  Sports & level (+grade), Activity panel (hosted / sports / member-since), and the existing Recommend/Remove actions. Match-only bits
  (% match, "why you match") are omitted since they don't apply to an already-connected member. Reuses the existing pm-*/dm-* CSS.
- No feed-loader change needed — the "View passport" link already routes through openCard → openPerson.
FILES TO DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (489) + `assets/ffp-member-profile.js` + `assets/ffp-connections-core.js`. DB already live.
VERIFIED: `node --check assets/ffp-connections-core.js` OK; profile module + dashboard verified via file tool (shell truncates them) —
module closes `};` (L818), dashboard ends `</body></html>` (L8431). FFP_BUILD 489, profile ?v=489, connections-core ?v=359.

## 🔒 LOCKED — FITNESS LEVEL VOCABULARY (do NOT change without Grant): **Just started · Recreational · Skilled · Highly skilled · Professional**
(label==value, sort 0–4). ONE connected vocabulary for member ability AND listing required-level (listings add "All Levels" on top via attendeeLevels).
Meter idx: Just started 1 / Recreational 2 / Skilled 3 / Highly skilled 4 / Professional 5. Origin: Build 401.
⚠️ The 2026-06-27 `fitness_level_taxonomy_clean_and_proper` migration WRONGLY reverted this to a dead set (Not Tried/Social/
Competitive/Representative) — restored 2026-06-29 (see below). This was an unapproved change that broke the visible levels for ~days.

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · PASSPORT CARD CONSOLIDATED TO ONE SOURCE (member `FFP_BUILD 487→488`)
Grant: "This should be a Passport card fix... have you mapped things out?" — correct. The flip opacity fix I'd added
was patched into a DUPLICATE. There were TWO `FFPPassportCard` renderers: the canonical `assets/ffp-passport-card.js`
AND a full inline copy in the dashboard (~L8017), each with its own flip CSS; the dashboard ran off the inline one and
never even loaded the asset → they drifted (asset had the opacity fix, inline didn't until I patched it). FIXED:
diffed both — the asset renderer is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the inline (ccode/meter/cell/frontShell/backShell/render/
ffpScaleCards/ffpFmtPassDate), the ONLY diff being the asset already dropped the fake RELIABILITY cell (uniform seed;
members_cards doesn't return it anyway → no visual change). So: dashboard now LOADS `assets/ffp-passport-card.js?v=488`
in <head> (L106) and the inline `window.FFPPassportCard = {…}` (91 lines) is REMOVED (marker left at L8018). The
`FFPCard` resolver (data layer, L8033) stays inline; `ffpFmtPassDate`/`ffpScaleCards` left inline (identical, harmless).
The asset's injected CSS is overridden by the existing later CSS (ffp-member.css L117 + #ffp-pc-styles) → zero visual change.
RESULT: the renderer is now ONE source — card/flip/meter/grade fixes apply on every surface from one file.
VERIFIED (file tool; shell truncates the dashboard at ~L8496 so reconstruction used shell front + file-tool tail + line-range
delete + asserts): asset script @L106, no inline `window.FFPPassportCard`, FFPCard kept, FFP_BUILD 488, ends `</body></html>` (L8430).
DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (488) + ensure `assets/ffp-passport-card.js` is deployed (it already backs other surfaces).
FOLLOW-UP (not done): the flip CSS still lives in BOTH the asset (injected) and the dashboard's `#ffp-pc-styles` (identical now);
fully single-sourcing the CSS means untangling card rules from that grab-bag block (it also holds .ffp-deck-flash etc.) + ffp-member.css — a separate careful pass.

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · PASSPORT/PROFILE follow-ups (same build 486; profile module `?v=486`)
- GRADE SHOWS ON PASSPORT: verified full path is correct (members_cards RPC returns `m.skills` incl. grade → FFPCard `_sports()`
  preserves grade → `backShell()` renders it in blue beside the sport). Gap was refresh: the self-card is cached (`_ffpSelfCard`) and
  `syncToPassport()` only synced identity. FIX: `ffpRenderSelfBack()` now overrides skills with LIVE `MemberProfile.data.sports`, and
  `syncToPassport()` calls it → grade/level edits show on the card immediately (and persist; RPC returns them on reload).
- EDIT SKILL LEVEL IN PROFILE (no delete/re-add): sport-card level is now tappable → `MemberProfile.editSportLevel(i)` re-opens the
  level picker (FFP_FITNESS_LEVELS) and updates in place.
- FILES: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (486) + `assets/ffp-member-profile.js` (?v=486). Verified via file tool (mount truncates these →
  node --check unusable): module closes `};` (L813), dashboard ends `</body></html>` (L8511).
- PASSPORT FLIP mirror-flash — FIXED (`FFP_BUILD 486→487`). FIRST diagnosis was WRONG (I claimed the front lacked `.ffp-pc-face .ffp-pc-front`
  — it does NOT; dashboard L336 already wraps the front. An earlier grep skipped L336; caught it by READING the markup before editing).
  REAL CAUSE: the dashboard's inline `<style id="ffp-pc-styles">` (L7957) had `backface-visibility:hidden` but was MISSING the opacity
  HARD-SWAP rules (`.ffp-pc-front{opacity:1;transition:opacity 0s linear .26s}` + `.pass-container.flipped .ffp-pc-front{opacity:0}` etc.) that
  ffp-passport-card.js has (L248–251). On iOS the backface-cull lags → the rich front shows mirrored mid-spin. The self card uses THIS inline
  CSS, not the asset's, so it never got the fix. FIX: copied the 4 opacity rules into the inline block (covers `.ffp-pc.flipped` + `.pass-container.flipped`).
  Reproduced both states in show_widget (RULE 4) — broken flashes, fixed is clean both ways — before shipping. Pure CSS in `ffp-member-dashboard.html`.

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · FITNESS LEVEL VOCABULARY restored everywhere (member `FFP_BUILD 485→486`, taxonomy `?v=8→9`, backend `v131→v132`)
Grant caught that the levels were wrong. Root cause: my earlier `fitness_level_taxonomy_clean_and_proper` migration converted the
CORRECT set (Just started/Recreational/Skilled/Highly skilled/Professional) INTO the dead old set (Not Tried/Social/Competitive/
Representative). Recovered the correct set from MASTER's own Build-401 note and restored it. FULL fix (Grant-approved):
- DB migration `fitness_level_restore_correct_vocabulary` (LIVE): renamed taxonomy items (label==value) + REMAPPED all stored values —
  members.skills (67 entries: Social→Recreational 36, Competitive→Skilled 17, Representative→Highly skilled 8, Not Tried→Just started 5,
  Professional 1), meetups (10+4), events (3+2), trips (2). Verified: zero old-vocab values remain.
- FRONTEND: `ffp-taxonomy.js` L209 fallback → correct 5 (node --check OK); dashboard meet-filter `<select>` (was Not Tried…) → correct 5;
  level-descriptions map `LD` → correct keys + reworded descriptions. Passport card `meter()` already had the correct set (Build 401) +
  legacy fallbacks, and the card prints the stored level word → now shows correct language after the remap.
- BACKEND `index.js` v132: AI parse prompts (meetup_search + meetup_compose) + `MS_LV`/`MC_LV` validation arrays → correct 5.
FILES TO DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (486, Netlify) + `assets/ffp-taxonomy.js` (Netlify) + `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js` (v132, Vercel). DB already live.
VERIFIED this turn: DB query (all 5 correct, no stragglers); ffp-taxonomy node --check OK; dashboard ends `</body></html>` (L8506); FFP_BUILD 486; taxonomy ?v=9.
GRADE IN PROFILE (done, same deploy): added per-sport Grade capture in `assets/ffp-member-profile.js` — `addSportFlow` now
pushes `{name, level, grade:''}`; each sport card has an inline-editable Grade field (reuses `.field-card-input-flat`,
placeholder "Grade — e.g. 5:30 pace, 17, B grade") wired to new `MemberProfile.setSportGrade(i,val)` → autoSave + syncToPassport.
Persists via the existing save path (payload `skills: d.sports` sends the full objects incl. grade). Passport card back already
prints `name · level · grade`. Profile module cache-bust `?v=485→486`. VERIFIED via file tool (mount truncates this file at L771 so
`node --check` is unusable — file tool shows the full 793-line module closing `};`, all 3 edits well-formed).

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · DASHBOARD SHRINK Module 3 — PROFILE EDITOR extracted to a module (member `FFP_BUILD 484→485`)
First "world-class module" extraction (Grant: "how should it be constructed? world-class proper build?"). Codified the
MODULE ARCHITECTURE STANDARD in FFP-ARCHITECTURE.md §9 and built to it. Moved the `MemberProfile` object (old L4607–5381,
775 lines) VERBATIM into NEW `assets/ffp-member-profile.js` as `window.MemberProfile = {…}`. Loaded via
`<script defer src="assets/ffp-member-profile.js?v=485">` (placed beside the other deferred cores, after the calorie-tracker
tag) — defer guarantees it's defined before boot `init()` (registered on DOMContentLoaded, L8722).
GUARDED the two previously-UNGUARDED boot calls (would have crashed boot if the module failed to load): `MemberProfile.render()`
→ `if (window.MemberProfile) MemberProfile.render();` (boot init), and the refresh-path call wrapped with `window.MemberProfile &&`.
KEPT inline as shared core: `Picker`/`openPicker`/`closePicker`, `NATIONALITY_ISO` (all only used by MemberProfile, but Picker is a
generic component → stays in the shell). No call sites changed (everything already calls `MemberProfile.x`).
RESULT: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` 9,280 → 8,507 lines (−773). Cumulative today: 13,815 → 8,507 lines, 1.88MB → ~470KB.
VERIFIED this turn: `node --check assets/ffp-member-profile.js` = OK (starts `window.MemberProfile = {`, ends `};`); HTML has no
`const MemberProfile = {` left, defer tag present, build 485, boot calls guarded, ends `</body></html>` (L8506, RULE 3.1).
FILES TO DEPLOY (both together): `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (485) + NEW `assets/ffp-member-profile.js`.
AWAITING DEPLOY → §8 smoke test, esp. open the **Profile panel** (edit fields, pickers, avatar, PIN, location) — that's the isolated risk surface.
NEXT: Log-Activity modal (wrap scattered fns into `window.FFPLogActivity`, update call sites — careful); then boot/render core + Journey Map LAST.

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · DASHBOARD SHRINK Module 2 — Events + Experiences REMOVED from Passport (member `FFP_BUILD 483→484`)
Grant: "Events, Experiences are not a part of the passport anymore — they only show on the booking platform." Verified
they were already orphaned in the Passport UI (NO `data-panel` nav button reaches them) — so this was dead-code removal,
not a feature change. REMOVED (member dashboard): the hidden `#panel-experiences` div + its comment header (old L656–704);
the `const Events` object + the `const Experiences` object incl. the EXPERIENCES comment header (old L6199–6662); the two
boot calls (`Events.init()` guard + the unguarded `Experiences.init();` — the latter would have crashed boot if the object
were removed without it); the `panel-experiences` entries in the lazy-loader map (`_panelLoaderSrc`) and the data-tab reload map.
KEPT (verified present): `Challenges` (object + `Challenges.init()` + `panel-challenges` nav/loader), `MeetMove`, all other panels.
RESULT: 9,796 → 9,280 lines (−517). `FFP_BUILD` 483→484 (verified). One harmless leftover: a comment at L1632 ("Detail modal —
used by Deals, Events, Experiences, Meetups") — the modal is still shared by Meetups/Deals; comment only, no code.
VERIFIED this turn (file tool): zero executable `Events`/`Experiences`/`panel-experiences` refs remain; ends `</body></html>` (L9279, RULE 3.1).
NOTE: post-CSS-extraction the file is 594KB → the shell mount now reads it FULLY again (the truncation only hit it while >1.8MB);
surgery was done in Python with per-anchor asserts (abort-before-write on any mismatch) + file-tool verification.
FILE TO DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (484). AWAITING DEPLOY (Grant commits → §8 smoke test → confirm Build 484).
PLAN UPDATE: Module 2 was "extract Events/Experiences to a loader" — superseded by Grant's note → REMOVED instead.
Remaining modules: (3) Log-Activity modal + Add-City; (4) Profile editor (`Picker`+`MemberProfile`); (5) LAST: Journey Map + `renderAll` core.

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · DASHBOARD SHRINK Module 1 — CSS extracted (member `FFP_BUILD 482→483`)
First step of the SHRINK priority, plan-first + Grant-approved. Extracted the single giant `<style>` block
(member dashboard lines 117–4136, 4,018 lines) VERBATIM into a new file `assets/ffp-member.css`, replaced in the
HTML by `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/ffp-member.css?v=483">` at line 117. ZERO behaviour change — pure move.
RESULT: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` went **1.88MB → 594KB (-68%)**, 13,815 → 9,796 lines. (Those CSS lines were long;
CSS file is 1.28MB.) The four other small inline `<style>` blocks + the quests CSS (`<style id="ffp-quests-css">` now
at L118) were left in place — only the big block moved.
CACHE-BUST: the CSS `<link>` uses `?v=483` (static, in <head>, no FOUC). Bump it alongside `FFP_BUILD` on any CSS change
(it does NOT auto-sync with FFP_BUILD — deliberate tradeoff, there's no build step). `FFP_BUILD` bumped 482→483 (L8411, verified).
FILES TO DEPLOY (both, together): `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + NEW `assets/ffp-member.css`.
VERIFIED this turn (file tool, authoritative): HTML ends `</body></html>` (L9796, RULE 3.1); `<link>` at L117; zero `:root {`
left in HTML; CSS file complete (`:root {` → final `}`), 4,018 lines, no stray `<style>` tag.
⚠️ TOOLING NOTE (important): the shell mount serves a TRUNCATED copy of the member dashboard (caps ~13,732 lines /
1.875MB; it cannot read the file's tail). The file TOOLS (Read/Write/Edit) see the true complete file. Surgery was done by
reading head/middle via shell + supplying the 84-line tail from the file tool, with byte-boundary asserts before writing, then
verifying every boundary via the file tool. NEVER let the shell rewrite this file's tail — it would re-truncate it (= outage).
INCOMPLETE / NEXT MODULES (per the approved plan): (2) `Events`/`Experiences`/`Challenges` objects → discovery loader;
(3) Log-Activity modal + Add-City; (4) Profile editor (`Picker`+`MemberProfile`); (5) LAST: Journey Map + `renderAll` core.
STATUS: **LIVE — Grant confirmed Build 483 working on device 2026-06-29** (both files deployed, Passport renders correctly).

## HOTFIX — 2026-06-29 · backend `index.js v130→v131` — LOGIN DEAD (backend 500 FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED)
ROOT CAUSE (verified on device — Vercel root `/` returned 500 FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED, crash at module load):
`index.js` line 990 read `const MAIL_FROM = process.env.MAIL_FROM || MAIL_FROM;` — a SELF-REFERENCE left by the
v129 email-standardisation `replace_all` (it replaced the literal default string with the variable name). With the
`MAIL_FROM` env var unset (it is — domain move is deliberately deferred), the `|| MAIL_FROM` reads MAIL_FROM during
its own `const` init → `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'MAIL_FROM' before initialization` → THROWS AT MODULE LOAD →
backend crashes on EVERY route, incl. `/api/auth/exchange` → no CORS header → login's exchange step = ERR_FAILED.
This is why login broke AFTER the v130 deploy (the older live backend didn't have the broken line).
FIX (v131): restored the literal default → `const MAIL_FROM = process.env.MAIL_FROM || '"Find Fit People" <noreply@ffppassport.com>';`
FILE: `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/ffp-passport-backend-main/index.js` — header bumped to v131, ends `module.exports = app;` (L5351, verified this turn).
DEPLOY: Grant → Vercel. CONFIRM ALIVE: open `https://ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/` → must show `{"status":"FFP Passport API running"}`. Then login completes.
RELATED (already fixed, separate file): the Supabase `verify 403` was the client fetch-wrapper injecting the member JWT into `/auth/v1/verify` — fixed in `assets/ffp-api-integration.js` (exclude `/auth/v1/`), deployed + confirmed gone from console.
PREVENTION: added CLAUDE.md RULE 3.1 — Read a file's last line + confirm it terminates (`</html>` / `module.exports = app;` / `})();`) before sharing. (Truncation + this self-ref were the two root causes of the ~5h 06-29 outage.)
INCOMPLETE: backend `index.js v131` AWAITING DEPLOY; member dashboard `FFP_BUILD 482` AWAITING DEPLOY (restores activities). Neither live until Grant commits.

## HOTFIX — 2026-06-29 · `FFP_BUILD 481` — ACTIVITIES NOT SHOWING
`renderAll()` ran all panels in one unguarded sequence; a runtime throw in any panel BEFORE `renderActivities`
(5th in the list) blanked everything after it. Wrapped each render call in try/catch so panels render
independently + errors log as `[renderAll] <panel>`. Activities now render regardless. Deploy `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (481).
NOTE: root throw not yet identified (couldn't reproduce remotely; need the console `[renderAll]` error to fix the failing panel itself).
LESSON: the shell mount serves TRUNCATED copies of files >~377KB — `node --check` via bash is UNRELIABLE on big files (member dashboard, backend index.js). VALIDATE against the Read tool / real file only.

## LATEST — 2026-06-29 · BIG SESSION — member `FFP_BUILD 471→481`, backend `index.js v126→v130`. DB migrations LIVE; ALL frontend/backend AWAITING DEPLOY (Grant deploys → nothing below is live until committed). Verified this turn: `FFP_BUILD='481'`, backend header `v130`.
⚠️ Written after the fact (session ran long un-logged). Treat the INCOMPLETE list as authoritative.

### DB migrations applied LIVE (in order)
1. `match_pool_real_overlap_filter` — `get_match_pool` returns only people sharing ≥1 sport OR same city (was newest-80-of-everyone).
2. `list_meetups_for_member_eligibility` — NEW RPC; meetup discovery respects host's audience (city/gender/age) + your own/joined.
3. `meetup_join_eligibility_and_notify_fix` — `join_meetup` rejects wrong-audience ('ineligible'); `host_meetup` notifies ACCEPTED connections both directions.
4. `milestones_pb_genuine_improvement_only` — PB fires only when the latest log beats the prior best.
5. `notifications_server_side_clear` — `members.notifs_cleared_at`; GET filters created<=cleared; POST `/api/notifications/clear`; `member_pending_reviews` respects it.
6. `fitness_level_taxonomy_clean_and_proper` — taxonomy label==value; migrated stray skill levels (Recreational→Social, Skilled→Competitive, Highly Skilled→Representative) + listings (+ Beginner→Not Tried).
7. `members_structured_geocoded_location` — members + `region,area,country_code,lat,lng,place_id,location_label` (indexed).
8. `places_cache_address_components` — places_cache + country/country_code/region/city/area.
9. `members_cards_add_area_region` — `members_cards` returns area+region.
10. `activity_meetup_region_area` — `activity_logs` + `meetups` + `region,area` columns.
11. `meetup_activity_persist_region_area` — `host_meetup` stores region/area; NEW `set_activity_location(p_me,p_log_id,p_region,p_area)`.

### Frontend / backend changes (AWAITING DEPLOY)
- Modals full-bleed (settings/milestones/activity-filter/fitness-picker/calorie copy-day). Flip mirror-flash fix (`ffp-passport-card.js`). Deck no-wrap + filtered refresh. Real matching (get_match_pool + honest client score, gender weighted). Connections real stats (no placeholders; reliability cell removed = was a seed). Calorie "Mar"→real month; week label. Notifications "Clear all" server-side (backend **v128**). AI Log-Activity parse adds steps/max_hr/hr_zones (backend **v127**). Email single `MAIL_FROM`="Find Fit People" (backend **v129**; to use @findfitpeople.com authorise SPF/DKIM then set Vercel env MAIL_FROM). Stats group-avg excl. self + "ahead of X%". Activity Grade per-sport (`ffp-profile-complete.html` + passport + all skills→sports mappings). Activity card shows place, NO maps link. **World-class location** (backend **v130**): `/api/places/details` structured components; Complete-Profile Places search; onboard + members PUT store location; existing-member profile Location card; `FFPLocPick` keeps structured components; passport "BASED IN" = area+city.

### ⚠️ INCOMPLETE / NEXT (do NOT assume done)
- **Meet/activity region+area FRONTEND wiring NOT done**: DB+RPCs accept region/area but the FORMS don't send them. TODO: `pmf-region`/`pmf-area` + `log-region`/`log-area` hidden inputs; `pmfSetLocation`/`logSetLocation` capture loc.region/area; **`ffp-connections-core.js` host submit (~L698-750)** add region/area to the `host_meetup` payload; activity submit (dashboard ~L11945) call `set_activity_location` after `log_activity`.
- Add `area` to `get_match_pool` (connection STRIP cards). Queue: #6 Quest engine, #1 Trends cohort.
- Native app (separate): App ID `com.findfitpeople.passport`, APNs key `A376D39TSC`, Firebase `find-fit-people-1549970686008`, `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in Vercel, configs in `mobile/`. Phase 3 on the Mac.

### DEPLOY (Grant) — nothing above is live until done
Backend `index.js` → Vercel (**v130**). Netlify → `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (**Build 480**), `ffp-profile-complete.html`, `ffp-passport-card.js`, `ffp-connections-core.js`, `ffp-profile-loader.js`, `ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js`, `ffp-calorie-tracker-core.js`, `ffp-calorie-tracker-loader.js`, `ffp-meet-move-loader.js`. DB migrations already LIVE. **TEST on device: signup, profile location, log-activity, meet-host (all critical paths).**

## LATEST — 2026-06-27 (pm) · TAXONOMY TABLE RENAME (DB done LIVE; frontend awaiting deploy)
Proper cleanup so DB table names == the canonical concepts (no more crossed `classes`/`experiences`).
Canonical: **Sessions**=sessions/classes · **Appointments**=1-on-1 at a facility · **Experiences**=one-off
bookable · **Events**=events · **Trips**=multi-day.
- **DB (LIVE, atomic migration `taxonomy_rename_tables_and_functions`):**
  `experiences`→`trips` (multi-day) · `class_sessions`→`experience_sessions` (occurrences) · `classes`→`experiences` (one-off).
  All 25 dependent functions rewritten to new table names via an in-transaction `pg_get_functiondef`+`regexp_replace`
  loop (word-bounded, so function NAMES were untouched and all RPC names still work). Verified: 0 functions
  reference the dead names; a rewritten RPC executes (reached its owner-guard, no missing-table error).
  `bookings.item_type` strings (`class`,`experience`,`class_session`,…) intentionally LEFT as-is (internal labels).
  Branch-test was unavailable (Supabase not on Pro); used an atomic all-or-nothing migration instead + post-verify.
- **Frontend (awaiting deploy — DB is already renamed, so the OLD live frontend's classes/experiences/trips
  reads are BROKEN until these ship):** updated table refs (`.from`, `safeSelect`, realtime-subscribe table args,
  count arrays) in: `ffp-admin-classes-loader.js`, `ffp-admin-experiences-loader.js`, `ffp-admin-overview-loader.js`,
  `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js`, `ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js`, `ffp-provider-notifications-loader.js`,
  `assets/ffp-experiences-loader.js`, `assets/ffp-member-discovery-loader.js`. Panel IDs / data-dtab / nav links /
  labels NOT changed (already correct). Cache-bust: member `FFP_BUILD 468→469`; provider classes `?v=22→23`,
  experiences `?v=17→18`, notifications `?v=3→4`; admin overview `+?v=2`, experiences `+?v=2`, classes `?v=2→3`.
- **Backend `index.js`:** NO change (no direct table queries — only RPCs + panel-id strings).
- **DEPLOY (Netlify, all together to minimise the window):** the 3 dashboards (member/provider/admin) + the 8
  loader files above. Backend untouched. Then confirm member avatar "Build 469" + open admin Tours/Experiences,
  provider Experiences/Trips, member discovery.

## LATEST — 2026-06-27 (pm) · PARTNER MODEL CHANGE — open signup, gated listings + Business section
Grant's new model: (a) ALL partners self-sign-up (no account approval); (b) LISTINGS need admin approval before
the booking platform; (c) the **Business section** is a paid **$99/mo** add-on, admin-granted (free for now).
- **DB (LIVE, migration `partner_model_business_access_and_listing_approval`):**
  - `providers.business_access boolean default false` (+ `business_access_at`, `business_access_by`, `business_access_requested_at`).
  - `provider_set_listing_status` now REJECTS providers setting `live`/`archived` (returns `needs_approval`) — they can
    only set draft/pending/paused. Only admin publishes (`status='live'`). Applies to Experiences/Trips/Events.
  - (Listing CREATE already defaulted Events+Trips→`pending`, one-off Experiences→`draft`; booking reads already filter `live`.)
- **Listing approval — already implemented frontend-side** (classes loader v7 "submit for review"; events + trips
  save as pending → "Submitted for review"). My DB change just enforces it server-side. Grant chose: approve
  **Experiences, Trips, Events** (Sessions + Appointments auto-publish).
- **Provider dashboard (ffp-provider-dashboard.html, awaiting deploy):**
  - Nav: **Check-ins + Announcements moved to the Manage section** (stay free). The rest of the **Business** section
    (Reviews, Members, Packages, Sessions, Appointments, Staff, Payments & Invoices) is GATED behind `business_access`.
  - Gated items show a `$99` lock pill → click opens `showBusinessUpgrade()` modal with **Request access**
    (`requestBusinessAccess()` stamps `providers.business_access_requested_at`). `showPanel` also blocks direct opens.
  - `ensureBusinessAccess()` lazy-loads the flag onto `window.FFP_PROVIDER` and re-renders nav. Validated JS in isolation.
- **Admin (DONE):** per-provider **Business-access toggle** added to the Providers drawer (admin-dashboard.html) →
  `AdminProviders.toggleBusiness(id)` in `ffp-admin-providers-loader.js` (loader now selects `business_access` +
  `business_access_requested_at`, maps them, shows a "requested" pill). Provider "Request access" goes via new
  SECURITY DEFINER RPC `provider_request_business_access(p_provider)` (direct .update is RLS-blocked).
- **Account approval = already effectively removed:** the account-level Applications queue (`ffp-admin-applications-loader.js`)
  is NOT wired into admin-dashboard.html (no script include, not in the panel-loader map), and self-signup
  (`/api/provider/signup`) already creates providers with `status='approved'`. So nothing to retire; the v118
  `/api/admin/provision-provider` endpoint is now **dormant** (harmless). "Become a partner" CTAs live on
  findfitpeople.com (booking team) — point them at self-signup there.
- **Switched ON (LIVE):** all 4 existing providers granted `business_access=true` (grandfathered, free for now);
  new signups start locked and use Request access.
- **Deploy:** provider + admin dashboards + `ffp-admin-providers-loader.js` → Netlify. Backend already has the new RPC (DB).

## LATEST — 2026-06-28 · SUNDAY SUMMARY redesigned (backend v126) — flat, graph-led, + Connect/Engage/Track
Grant approved a mockup, then "add them and build". renderSundaySummary rebuilt: **no boxes, no pills.** Ranking pills →
horizontal bars (ssGraphRow); coach note + tier status de-boxed (flat left-accent / inline bar). NEW: 7-day "week in
motion" bar graph, Nutrition strip, WHOOP recovery line, top milestone banner, and a **Connect / Engage / Track** nudge
block (ssNudge) that drives platform behaviour with real data. Cron (`/api/cron/sunday-summary`) enriches the digest:
`week_days`/`active_days` (activity_logs), `nutrition` (food_logs avg kcal + days), `wearable` (member_wearable_daily
recovery/strain), `milestone` (member_milestones this week) — all defensive (each section hides if data absent).
Old boxed builders (statusHtml/ssRankRow) left as harmless dead code. Verified: function executes + renders. 
Deploy: backend index.js **v126** → Vercel. TEST: `GET /api/cron/sunday-summary?secret=<CRON_SECRET>&only=grant@findfitpeople.com`.

## 2026-06-28 · NATIVE APPS plan + NATIVE PUSH Phase 1 (backend v125)
Plan to ship the Passport as iOS/Android apps (Capacitor) with native push — full spec in **FFP-NATIVE-APP-SPEC.md**
(accounts/keys, push architecture, OAuth/Stripe/deep-link integration, store gotchas, OTA updates, phased plan).
- **Phase 1 BUILT (safe to deploy; dormant until Firebase env + a device):** DB `device_push_tokens` +
  `POST /api/push/register-device | /unregister-device`. `sendPushToMember`/`sendPushToAll` now ALSO send via
  **FCM HTTP v1** (service-account JWT→access token; prune UNREGISTERED) **alongside** the existing web push — so
  milestones/bookings/coach/broadcasts reach native iOS/Android with zero extra wiring. Web bridge
  `assets/ffp-native-push.js` (registers the device token in the native shell; no-op in browser). Validated (node --check).
- **NEEDS later:** Vercel env `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (Firebase service-account key) + Apple Dev ($99/yr) + Play ($25)
  + APNs .p8 → Firebase + a Mac/Xcode for Phase 3 (Capacitor shell + OTA + submit).
- **Updates after launch:** with an OTA layer (Capgo/Appflow) the apps update like the web (change→commit→bump→confirm,
  live in minutes); only native-shell changes need a store re-submission. (See spec §6b.)
- **Phase 3 pre-built (ready for the Mac):** `capacitor.config.json` (appId com.findfitpeople.passport, FFP teal splash,
  push config), `mobile/apple-app-site-association.template` + `mobile/assetlinks.json.template` (deep-link verification,
  fill TEAMID/SHA-256), and spec §8 runbook (CLI) + §9 store-listing checklist + §10 OAuth/deep-link/Stripe native snippets.
- **Deploy:** backend index.js **v125** → Vercel.

## 2026-06-28 · GOOGLE CALENDAR connector — backend built (v122), needs Google Cloud setup + frontend
Shared connector for the Professionals dashboard (pro appointments→their calendar) AND the Booking app (member booking→their calendar).
- **DB (LIVE):** `google_calendar` (member_id PK, tokens, calendar_id, google_email, status — RLS service-role only,
  tokens are secrets) + `calendar_oauth_states` (state→member_id+return_to, single-use, 10-min).
- **Backend v122 (mirrors the WHOOP OAuth pattern):** `POST /api/calendar/google/connect {refresh, return_to?}`
  → consent URL; `GET /api/calendar/google/callback` exchanges code + stores tokens (+ email from id_token) + bounces
  back; `POST /api/calendar/google/status|disconnect {refresh}`; `POST /api/calendar/add-event {refresh, event:{summary,
  description,location,start,end}}` writes to the caller's calendar. `getValidGoogleAccess` refreshes; all calls have
  15s timeouts + never throw. Keyed by member_id so it works for members AND pros (a pro is a member account).
- **⚠️ NEEDS (Grant) before it works/tests:** Google Cloud project → OAuth consent screen (External; add scope
  `.../auth/calendar.events` + openid/email; add yourself as a test user) → OAuth Client (Web) with redirect URI
  `https://ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/api/calendar/google/callback` → set Vercel env `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` +
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. (Sensitive scope → Google app verification needed before public, fine for testing now.)
- **Stage 2 — MEMBER side DONE (env now set + backend redeployed):** Passport Profile › Connected devices now has a
  **Google Calendar** row (Connect / Disconnect + shows the connected email) — added to `assets/ffp-wearables-loader.js`
  (`gcalConnect`/`gcalDisconnect` + `calRow`, hits /api/calendar/google/connect|status|disconnect with ffp_refresh).
  Member dashboard handles the `?gcal=connected|error` OAuth-return toast inline. Validated (additions pass node --check).
  CONNECT CONFIRMED WORKING end-to-end by Grant (member connected).
- **SETTINGS panel (FFP_BUILD 471):** avatar menu "Data sharing" item replaced with **Settings** → `ffpOpenSettings()`
  opens a modal with **Connected apps** (the `#mp-wearables` block — WHOOP/Garmin/Google Calendar, moved off the
  Profile) + **Data sharing** (row → `FFPProAccess.open()`). Removed the Profile "Connected devices" section. Wearables
  loader repointed `panel-profile`→`panel-settings`; ffpOpenSettings injects the loader on open if not already loaded.
- **Stage 2 — PROFESSIONALS dashboard connect DONE (PRO_BUILD 88→89):** avatar menu now has **Settings** →
  `openProSettings()` modal (openModalShell) with **Connected apps → Google Calendar** connect/disconnect
  (`proCalConnect/proCalRender/proCalDisconnect`, `_proCalRefresh` = FFPAuth.getRefresh || ffp_refresh) + `?gcal` toast.
  Validated (node --check).
- **Stage 2 — PRO APPOINTMENT → CALENDAR DONE (backend v123, PRO_BUILD 89):** the pro scheduling occurrence action
  sheet (`openOccActions`) now has **"Add to my Google Calendar"** → `proAddOccToCal` builds the event from the slot
  (date+start_time+duration_min, service/title + client names, location) and POSTs `/api/calendar/add-event` with the
  pro's ffp_refresh + `tz` (FFP_PROVIDER.timezone). Backend v123: `add-event` now sets start/end `timeZone` from `event.tz`
  so it lands at the right local time. 409 if not connected → toast "Connect first". (Per-appointment, user-triggered =
  no dedup needed; auto-fire-on-booking can come later if wanted.) Validated (node --check).
- **Booking-team contract DONE:** added to FFP-BOOKINGS.md — member connects in Passport; on booking the booking app
  POSTs `/api/calendar/add-event {refresh, event{summary,description,location,start,end,tz}}` (409 not_connected → ignore).
- **Booking contract LOCKED + honoured (backend v124):** `/api/calendar/add-event` accepts the booking-team shape
  `{booking_id,title,start_utc,end_utc,timezone,location,description,url}` (+ original); **booking_id = idempotency key**
  (tagged via Google extendedProperties.private.ffp_booking_id → no dupes; end defaults +60min). Split: booking site
  fires for **free/credit/held**; **Passport fires PAID** inside `finalisePaidCheckout` (member_id + scheduled_at +
  provider name/tz → gcalAddEvent, dedup `booking:<id>`). Both fire-and-forget. Contract written in FFP-BOOKINGS.md.
- **OPTIONAL later:** no-OAuth "Add to Google Calendar" template link for non-connected users.
- **Deploy:** backend index.js **v124** → Vercel; ffp-professional-dashboard.html (89) + ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js → Netlify.
- **Deploy:** backend index.js v122 → Vercel (done by Grant); member dashboard + `assets/ffp-wearables-loader.js` → Netlify.
- **TEST now:** Passport → Profile → Connected devices → Connect (Google Calendar) → consent → returns "connected".

## 2026-06-28 · MILESTONES / PBs celebration (backend v121) + STAFF ROLES deferred
Roadmap #56 (milestones) DONE; #68 (staff roles) DEFERRED with reason below.
- **DB (LIVE):** `member_milestones` (member_id, kind, dedup_key UNIQUE per member+kind, title/body/icon/value,
  achieved_at, seen_at, pushed_at) + RLS self-select/update. `detect_member_milestones(p_member)` — idempotent:
  PB distance + PB duration per activity (only once ≥2 logs), 7/14/30/50/100/365-day streaks (gap-islands on
  logged_at days, must be current), new-country (beyond their first). Returns unseen as jsonb. `member_mark_milestones_seen(p_member)`.
  Verified on a real member (PBs + 7/14-day streaks detected correctly).
- **Backend v121:** `POST /api/milestones/check {member_id}` → runs detect, phone-pushes NEW (unseen+unpushed)
  milestones once (`pushed_at` dedup; if >3 new → ONE combined push so an existing member's first run doesn't flood),
  returns all unseen for the popup.
- **Member app (ffp-member-dashboard.html, inline → deploys fresh):** `ffpCheckMilestones()` POSTs the endpoint,
  shows a celebration overlay (`ffpShowMilestones`, top 3 + "+N more", combined title if many), then marks seen.
  Called on load (poll for member.id → 2.5s) + 1.2s after a successful Log Activity. Validated (node --check).
- **#68 STAFF ROLES — DEFERRED (not a small enforcement tweak):** recon found staff CANNOT log into the partner
  dashboard at all — `provider_staff` is just a directory (name/role/`access_level`); no staff login, no staff session,
  no `staff_role` on FFP_PROVIDER. So enforcement needs **staff accounts + login built first** (staff OTP login →
  session carrying access_level → hydrate FFP_PROVIDER → gate panels/actions → backend RPC guards). Recommend doing it
  as its own focused epic. The owner can already assign access levels in the Staff panel; they just aren't enforceable yet.
- **Deploy:** backend index.js v121 → Vercel; member dashboard → Netlify. (DB already live.)

## 2026-06-27 (pm) · AI ENDPOINTS verified + hardened (backend v120)
Roadmap #66. Audited every AI endpoint (workout/generate, nutrition/plan, pro/workout/draft, ai/parse, workout/summary,
agent/chat, coach note + Sunday summary). All already guard a missing key (503 `ai_not_configured`) + API errors (502
`ai_error`) inside try/catch; front-ends already degrade gracefully (calorie loader handles 503 / unparseable / network
and re-enables the button — the canonical pattern). Hardening added: a **25s `AbortSignal.timeout` on all 8 Anthropic
calls** so a hung model returns cleanly instead of hanging; the agent helper now returns `{error:'ai_timeout'|'ai_unreachable'}`.
Deploy: backend index.js v120 → Vercel.

## 2026-06-27 (pm) · ADMIN OPS — provider APPROVE fixed (backend v118, awaiting deploy)
Ecosystem-review roadmap item #67 (admin ops), part 1.
- **BUG FOUND + FIXED:** the admin Applications-queue **Approve** button POSTs to `/api/admin/provision-provider`,
  but that route **never existed** in the backend → Approve silently failed (404). (Reject already worked — direct
  Supabase update.) Built the route in `index.js` **v118** + a new `verifyAdminAccessJwt(authHeader)` helper
  (verifies the admin's Supabase access JWT via SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET → `members.id`, then checks `admin_users`).
  The endpoint: loads the application, find-or-creates the member by email (upgrades an existing account to provider),
  inserts the `providers` row with chosen `subscription_tier` / `paid_until` / `monthly_fee_aed` + `payments_status='not_connected'`,
  marks the application `approved` (`reviewed_by`/`reviewed_at`), emails the welcome/invite (`sendProviderWelcomeEmail`).
  Mirrors `/api/provider/signup`. Verified: new blocks pass `node --check` in isolation (full-file check hits the
  known mount-truncation false positive at L3741, pre-existing).
- **PREREQ:** needs `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` set in Vercel (already required by `mintSupabaseJwt`; admin RLS reads imply it's set).
- **No frontend change** — `ffp-admin-applications-loader.js` already calls this exact contract.
- **Deploy:** backend `index.js` → Vercel. Test: in admin → Applications → Approve a pending application → provider created + listed.
- **Broadcast targeting — DONE (backend v119):** `POST /api/admin/broadcast` now takes a `segment`
  `{type:'membership'|'country'|'gender', value}` resolved server-side to member_ids (status='active'); 'all' still
  broadcasts to everyone. Admin Broadcast panel got an Audience picker (All / Passport / Free / Women / Men / By country)
  — in-app rows + phone push both honour it; result shows the count + segment. Admin dashboard is inline (deploys fresh).
- **GDPR — DONE (DB live):** SECURITY DEFINER RPCs `admin_export_member(p_admin,p_member)` (dynamic dump of every
  member_id table → JSON, EXCLUDING secrets: member_wearables/wearable_oauth_states/push_subscriptions + access_code)
  and `admin_erase_member(p_admin,p_member,p_confirm)` (deletes ~35 behavioural/health tables, anonymizes the members
  row — email/name/phone/city/etc. + status='deleted' — KEEPS financial/booking rows de-identified; blocks erasing an
  admin; requires p_confirm). Admin member drawer has Export + Erase buttons (`AdminMembers.exportData/eraseData`,
  double-confirm). Verified export runs (30+ sections). Admin dashboard is inline (deploys fresh); no backend change for GDPR.
- **Bulk actions — DONE:** multi-select where it's actually needed — the listing approval queues + Members.
  Admin Experiences (`ffp-admin-classes-loader.js` v→4) + Trips (`ffp-admin-experiences-loader.js` v→3): per-row
  checkbox (pending tab) + "Select all" + a bulk bar → **Approve selected / Reject selected** via one
  `.update({status}).in('id', ids)`. Members (inline `AdminMembers`): checkbox + bulk bar → **Verify / Suspend selected**.
  All validated (node --check).
- **#67 ADMIN OPS COMPLETE:** provider approve fixed (v118) · payouts already full · broadcast targeting (v119) ·
  GDPR export+erasure · bulk actions. Deploy: backend index.js v119 → Vercel; admin dashboard + the 2 listing loaders → Netlify.

## 2026-06-27 · COACH MEMORY (Phase 1) shipped to code (awaiting deploy)
The "always-learning Coach" foundation. Spec: `FFP-COACH-MEMORY-SPEC.md` (3 pillars; this is Pillar 1).
- **DB (LIVE):** new table `member_coach_profile` (member_id pk → members, `summary` text, `facts` jsonb, `support_ops` jsonb, updated_at). RLS ENABLED, no policies = service-role only.
- **Backend `index.js` v111:** `computeCoachProfile(memberId)` — distils last-45d `activity_logs` + last-14d `member_wearable_daily` + `member_connections` into deterministic `facts` {activities_30d, weekly_cadence, top_activity, last_active_days, momentum rising/steady/slipping, latest_recovery, latest_strain, avg_sleep_7d, connections, at_risk} + ONE cheap Haiku `summary` (WORKOUT_MODEL); upserts the row. Endpoints: `POST /api/coach/profile {refresh}` (on-demand, returns cached if <24h else recomputes), `GET /api/cron/coach-profiles` (CRON_SECRET-gated nightly batch; `?only=<member|email>` for a safe single test). Sunday-summary `coach_note` now calls computeCoachProfile + injects the memory so the note is personal.
- **`vercel.json`:** added cron `/api/cron/coach-profiles` @ `0 2 * * *` (daily 02:00 UTC) — 3 crons now.
- **NOT YET:** no member-app UI reads `/api/coach/profile` yet (Phase 1 is backend foundation + Sunday wiring). Phases 2 (daily nudge rules → notifyMember) + 3 (social `support_ops`) read the same profile next.
- **Deploy:** backend (index.js + vercel.json) → Vercel. CRON_SECRET already set (Sunday cron uses it). TEST: `GET /api/cron/coach-profiles?secret=<CRON_SECRET>&only=grant@findfitpeople.com` then check `member_coach_profile`.

### Phase 2 — COACH NUDGES (backend v112, shipped to code 2026-06-27)
- **DB (LIVE):** `member_coach_profile` += `last_nudge_at timestamptz`, `last_nudge_key text` (1/day enforcement + no-repeat).
- **Backend v112:** `evalCoachNudge(memberId, facts)` — PURE rules (no AI) over `facts` + TODAY's `member_wearable_daily.recovery_pct` + whether they logged today → ONE message: `recovery_low` (rec<34 → ease off), `recovery_high` (rec≥67 & none logged → push), `nudge_back` (at_risk & none logged), `momentum` (slipping & ≥2 days idle). Delivered via `notifyMember` = bell + push, **NO email**. Cron `GET /api/cron/coach-nudges` (CRON_SECRET-gated; `?only=<member|email>`, `?dry=1` to preview without sending). Honours `preferences.no_coach_nudges`. 1/day via last_nudge_at.
- **vercel.json:** cron `/api/cron/coach-nudges` @ `0 3 * * *` (03:00 UTC, AFTER profiles refresh @02:00). 4 crons now.
- **TEST:** `GET /api/cron/coach-nudges?secret=<SECRET>&only=grant@findfitpeople.com&dry=1` → returns `candidates[]` (what WOULD send) without notifying. Drop `&dry=1` to actually send.
### Phase 3 — SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY (backend v113, shipped to code 2026-06-27)
- **Backend v113:** `computeCoachProfile` now also derives `support_ops` (stored in `member_coach_profile.support_ops`, returned by `/api/coach/profile`): for each ACCEPTED `member_connections`, a connection QUIET (last active 10-60d) → `{kind:'quiet',name,days}`; on a STREAK (≥3 consecutive days to today) → `{kind:'streak',name,streak}`; plus the member's own upcoming hosted `meetups` (next 7d, status≠cancelled) with `max_people` − attendees > 0 → `{kind:'meetup_fill',title,spots}`. Capped 6. `socialNudge(ops)` is the coach-nudges FALLBACK when no personal nudge fires (social_quiet / social_streak / social_meetup).
- **PRIVACY (hard rule):** only a connection's activity STATUS (active/quiet/streak) crosses between members — NEVER another member's health/wearable metrics. (Strava, when added, stays owner-only.)
- **TEST:** `GET /api/cron/coach-nudges?secret=<SECRET>&only=grant@findfitpeople.com&dry=1` → if no personal nudge, candidates show the social one. `/api/coach/profile` now returns `support_ops[]`.
- **Passport "Support your crew" card — BUILT (FFP_BUILD 459).** `ffp-member-dashboard.html`: new `#trend-crew` container (after #trend-card, OUTSIDE it so it shows even with no logs) + `renderTrendCrew()` (POSTs `/api/coach/profile`, renders support_ops as tappable rows: quiet/streak → `MeetMove.openMemberDetail(member_id)`, meetup_fill → info). Called from `renderAll()` right after `renderTrend()`. Styled to match the "Your Trends" tile (blue chip header `volunteer_activism`, rgba(43,168,224,.06) panel). Activity status only — no health crosses members.
- **ALL 3 COACH PHASES now shipped to code.** Deploy = backend index.js+vercel.json (v113) → Vercel; ffp-member-dashboard.html (459) → GitHub/Netlify.

## 🚧 BOUNDARIES — DO NOT CROSS (added 2026-06-21 at Grant's explicit, repeated instruction. READ FIRST.)
1. **The PASSPORT member app (`ffp-member-dashboard.html`) is PREMIUM and SEPARATE.** It has NOTHING to do with
   professional/partner sessions, client management, forms or billing. **NEVER edit it as part of professional/partner/
   booking work** — not even a CSS tweak. If the Passport app genuinely needs a change, that is its OWN task: ask first.
2. **Client management = the professional/partner DASHBOARDS + the BOOKING platform — NOT the Passport app.**
   The member-facing side (a member adding/updating their own details, COMPLETING/SIGNING forms) is the BOOKING
   platform's job, never the Passport app.
3. **Hand BOOKING a spec — never build their side.** When the pro/partner side needs the member-facing counterpart,
   write the contract in `FFP-BOOKINGS.md` for the booking team. Never edit the booking repo directly.
4. Pulling a client's identity into a pro/partner record via `pro_client_passport` (already approved) is fine — that is
   a READ of agreed fields, not the Passport app.

## 🧱 PLATFORM STATE & STABILITY / UX ROADMAP — verified 2026-06-25 (READ AFTER BOUNDARIES · ALWAYS APPLY)

> VERIFIED snapshot (live Supabase DB + workspace files read this session) + the standing stability/reliability/UX
> plan. Durable memory: re-verify with a tool before contradicting (RULE 0); the device "Build N" stamp is the only
> truth for what is LIVE. Findings are facts read on 2026-06-25; tracking-log statuses are OPEN until a tool confirms a fix.

### A. Architecture (verified file map)
- **Frontend (Netlify · ffppassport.com · repo grant2223/ffp-passport@main):** 4 dashboards — `ffp-member-dashboard.html`
  (Passport member app, PREMIUM/SEPARATE), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (facility/partner), `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`
  (coach/pro), `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (admin) — plus `login.html`, `ffp-profile-complete.html`, `provider-signup.html`,
  marketing pages (index/about/partner/privacy/terms/refund/welcome).
- **Module-pair pattern (the spine):** each big panel = a deferred CORE (`assets/ffp-<panel>-core.js`, defines `window.X`)
  + a lazy LOADER (`assets/ffp-<panel>-loader.js` or root `ffp-<role>-<panel>-loader.js`, fetched when the panel opens).
  ~63 loaders (admin ×22, provider ×17, pro ×4, member ×2, asset feature loaders ×~15). CHANGE ONE → CHECK ITS PARTNER.
- **Cache-bust:** loader change → bump the role build constant; CORE/module change → bump ITS `?v=N`. Always BOTH sides.
- **Backend (Vercel · ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app):** ONE Express file
  `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/ffp-passport-backend-main/index.js` (v101, ~266KB) — auth/JWT mint, Resend email,
  notify, quests, Stripe Connect, agent. Root verified live 2026-06-25: `{"status":"FFP Passport API running"}`.
- **DB (Supabase `kxzyuofecmtymablnmak` "FFP Passport 2026", Postgres 17.6, ACTIVE_HEALTHY):** ONE DB shared by Passport +
  Find Fit People. **Members are the `anon` role** (anon key + custom JWT) → every member write MUST go through a
  SECURITY DEFINER RPC that asserts the caller internally (the auth.uid trap). Stripe: 0/4 providers, 0/3 pros connected.
- **Two apps, one core:** Passport = identity/loyalty/social (no paid booking here). Find Fit People = marketplace
  (book/pay, Stripe/AED). Membership fields + $99 subscription owned by Passport; per-booking payments owned by FFP.

### B. Build reality (workspace constants read 2026-06-25 — device "Build N" stamp is the ONLY live truth)
- **Member** `ffp-member-dashboard.html`: live `FFP_BUILD='436'` (L8236); header is v361 title / v362 changelog ("416→417", L4).
  ⚠️ the constant (436) is AHEAD of the documented changelog (417) — reconcile so the changelog matches the real build.
- **Pro** `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`: live `var PRO_BUILD='77'` (L581), v76 changelog. ⚠️ stale comment "PRO_BUILD='7'" at L6 — ignore it.
- **Admin** `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`: visible stamp `build v48` (L1534), v47→v48 header. OK.
- **Provider** `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`: header v67. (In-app stamp not re-grep'd this turn — verify before bumping.)

### C. DB AUDIT — live Supabase advisor findings (2026-06-25). Status OPEN unless noted. Do NOT apply blind — see §D order.
**Security (19 ERROR · 695 WARN · 39 INFO):**
- 🔴 **P0 — 11 public tables with RLS DISABLED** (directly reachable with the anon key): `provider_appointments`,
  `provider_trainer_slots`, `provider_trainer_blocks`, `provider_services`, `provider_service_coaches`, `provider_packages`,
  `provider_client_packages`, `pro_services`, `quest_tasks`, `quest_task_completions`, `feature_days`. → Enable RLS. If a
  table is only ever touched via SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, RLS-on + no-policy suffices (RPCs bypass RLS). VERIFY each table's
  access path FIRST so reads don't break.
- 🔴 **P0 — 8 SECURITY DEFINER views** run as creator, bypassing the caller's RLS: `sessions_public`, `professionals_public`,
  `provider_plans_public`, `provider_staff_public`, `session_templates_public`, `pro_packages_public`, `pro_videos_public`,
  `event_tickets_public`. → Recreate with `security_invoker=on` (PG15+) unless definer is deliberate.
- 🟠 **P1 — always-true RLS policy:** `provider_applications.provider_apps_self_insert` (INSERT WITH CHECK always true) →
  anyone can insert applications (spam vector). Scope the check.
- 🟠 **P1 — 3 public buckets allow LISTING** (`avatars`, `form-files`, `quest-images`): broad SELECT lets clients list ALL
  files; `form-files` may expose other members' signed forms. → Drop the list policy (object URLs still work).
- 🟡 **P2 — 3 functions w/ mutable search_path** (`ffp_haversine_m`, `ffp_jsonb_to_text_array`, `ffp_validate_booking_details`)
  → pin `search_path`. **Leaked-password protection DISABLED** → enable HIBP in Auth (one-click).
- ✅ **BY DESIGN (no action):** 687 "anon/authenticated can execute SECURITY DEFINER function" WARNs + 39 "RLS enabled, no
  policy" INFOs = the FFP anon-RPC model. Keep — but each such RPC MUST assert the caller internally.

**Performance (216 findings):**
- 🟠 **P1 — auth_rls_initplan ×71:** RLS policies re-evaluate `auth.<fn>()`/`current_setting()` PER ROW. Wrap as
  `(select auth.uid())` → big, safe latency win on the busiest tables (members, activity_logs, …).
- 🟠 **P1 — multiple_permissive_policies ×124:** consolidate overlapping permissive policies (each runs per row).
- 🟡 **P2 — unindexed_foreign_keys ×46:** add covering indexes (hot FKs first: activity_logs.*, bookings, pro_*).
- 🟡 **P2 — unused_index ×20 / duplicate_index ×1:** drop the duplicate on `members`
  (`members_referral_code_key` vs `members_referral_code_unique`); review "unused" before dropping (new-project low traffic).

### D. STABILITY / RELIABILITY / UX ROADMAP — so the app is QUICK, EASY, SMOOTH (do P0→P2, one change at a time, verify after each)
**P0 — correctness, security, trust:**
1. Lock down the 11 RLS-disabled tables + 8 SECURITY DEFINER views (§C). Get Grant's go; apply per-table; re-run advisors.
2. Reconcile version tracking: ONE constant per surface; the header changelog MUST equal the live constant (member 436 vs 417).
**P1 — speed the user feels:**
3. auth_rls_initplan rewrite + permissive-policy consolidation → faster reads on every authenticated query.
4. De-fragile the **1.75 MB / 13.3k-line member-dashboard monolith** by continuing panel extraction (done: Fitness Stats;
   next: Calorie Tracker). Smaller first paint, safer edits, fewer "works then breaks" regressions.
5. Remove repo footguns: stray `ffp-member-dashboard.html.bak_earnings_extract` (1.73 MB) + `versions/` dupe invite editing
   the wrong file. Keep history in git, not as live-folder duplicates.
**P2 — polish & headroom:**
6. FK covering indexes + duplicate-index cleanup; bucket-listing, search_path, and HIBP hardening.
7. Standardise loader headers so every file's `vN` is unambiguous.

### E. ISSUES & UPDATES TRACKING LOG (append newest on top — id · date · area · severity · status)
- I-008 · 2026-06-25 · DB/security · P2 · OPEN — 3 mutable-search_path fns; leaked-password protection off.
- I-007 · 2026-06-25 · DB/perf · P2 · OPEN — 46 unindexed FKs; 20 unused + 1 duplicate index (members.referral_code).
- I-006 · 2026-06-25 · DB/security · P1 · OPEN — provider_applications always-true INSERT; 3 public buckets list-exposed.
- I-005 · 2026-06-25 · structure · P1 · IN PROGRESS — member dashboard monolith.
    · 2026-06-26 CLEANUP: DELETED the 1.73 MB `ffp-member-dashboard.html.bak_earnings_extract` + the 1.82 MB
      `versions/ffp-member-dashboard-v274.html` dupe (3.5 MB of repo footguns gone). EXTRACTED the wearables logic to
      `assets/ffp-wearables-loader.js` (lazy via `_panelLoaderSrc['panel-profile']`) — no new inline JS in the HTML.
      TRIMMED the top changelog comment 174 → ~29 lines (latest 5; rest in git). NEXT: extract more inline objects
      (log-photo helpers, renderTrend) per the proven verbatim pattern.
- I-004 · 2026-06-25 · DB/perf · P1 · OPEN — auth_rls_initplan ×71 + multiple_permissive_policies ×124.
- I-003 · 2026-06-25 · versioning · P1 · OPEN — member FFP_BUILD 436 vs changelog 417; pro stale "='7'" comment.
- I-002 · 2026-06-25 · DB/security · P0 · OPEN — 8 SECURITY DEFINER `*_public` views bypass caller RLS.
- I-001 · 2026-06-25 · DB/security · P0 · OPEN — 11 public tables RLS-disabled (list in §C).

### F. ALWAYS APPLY (committed to memory)
1. **Verify before claiming (RULE 0)** — read the live file/DB THIS turn; the device Build stamp is the only "live" truth.
2. **One source of truth per thing** — reuse the canonical component/RPC; never reinvent; bump exactly one version constant.
3. **Member Passport app is OFF-LIMITS** for pro/partner/booking work (Boundaries). Hand BOOKING a spec; never build their side.
4. **Every member write = a SECURITY DEFINER RPC** that asserts the caller; never rely on client-side RLS for members.
5. **Root-cause, world-class, all devices — never a patch;** reproduce + verify in a render before sharing.
6. **Keep THIS section current** and append to the tracking log (§E) as issues are found/fixed.
7. **DESIGN — modern & clean. NO bordered "boxes"/cards and NO "pills" (rounded chip badges).** Use whitespace, type
   hierarchy and thin hairline dividers — never filled, bordered panels or pill chips. (Grant, repeatedly. Applies to
   EVERY surface. If a design adds a boxed card or a pill, it's wrong — redo it clean.)
8. **PRICING — MEMORISE, the ONLY correct numbers: Passport membership = $20/month OR $149/year (≈40% off annual).**
   The old "$99/year" is WRONG everywhere — replace it on sight. ($99 ONLY ever = the per-day FEATURED-listing fee — a
   completely different thing.) Copy/positioning: the Passport is about JOINING THE COMMUNITY to connect & engage with
   active people like you — lead with that, not feature lists.

## ⏩ HANDOFF — last worked 2026-06-27 (WEARABLES: WHOOP direct integration — LIVE & WORKING)

**WEARABLES (WHOOP direct, OAuth 2.0 + webhooks + pull-sync) — built & verified end-to-end 2026-06-27.**
Chosen path: connect Garmin + WHOOP **directly** (both free APIs); Strava parked (its 2024 rule = data shown only to its
owner). Terra aggregator parked. WHOOP is LIVE; Garmin pending Garmin Connect Developer Program approval (Grant emailed —
their self-serve access form was showing "stay tuned"). Setup doc: `FFP-WEARABLES-SETUP.md`.
- **DB (live):** `member_wearables` (per-member tokens; RLS-locked, service-role only) · `activity_logs` += `source`,
  `external_id` (dedup unique idx), `metrics` jsonb (max_hr, strain, hr_zones_ms) · `member_wearable_daily`
  (sleep_hours/efficiency/performance, recovery_pct, resting_hr, hrv_ms, strain; per day, merged) · `wearable_oauth_states`
  (short hex CSRF state, single-use) · `wearable_debug` (sync error log — read it when a sync silently 0's).
- **Backend `index.js` v110 (Vercel):** `POST /api/wearables/connect {refresh,provider}` → WHOOP auth widget (state stored
  in wearable_oauth_states — WHOOP MANGLES long signed states, so use a SHORT hex one) · `GET …/whoop/callback` (token
  exchange + profile → member_wearables) · `POST …/whoop/webhook` (raw-body HMAC-SHA256 sig check; handles workout.* +
  sleep.updated) · `POST …/whoop/sync` (PULLS workouts + sleep + recovery + cycle/strain — open backfill, no date cap) ·
  `POST …/disconnect` · `POST …/status` · `POST …/daily` (last 30 days). Scopes: `offline read:profile read:workout
  read:sleep read:recovery read:cycles` (cycles=plural=strain; MUST be ticked on the WHOOP app AND users must RE-CONNECT
  to re-grant after scope changes). GOTCHAS fixed: (1) state length → short hex; (2) invalid_scope → read:cycle→read:cycles
  + trimmed; (3) every insert silently failed → `activity_logs_duration_sec_check` (duration_sec is the 0-59 SECONDS
  COMPONENT, not total seconds) → duration_min=floor(totalSec/60), duration_sec=totalSec%60; (4) whoopUpsertActivity now
  THROWS on insert error (was swallowing → "synced 23" but 0 saved). Vercel env: WHOOP_CLIENT_ID, WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET.
- **Frontend:** Profile › "Connected devices" logic in `assets/ffp-wearables-loader.js` (lazy via
  `_panelLoaderSrc['panel-profile']` — NOT inline). Connect/Disconnect/**Sync now** + status + a "From WHOOP · latest" card
  (recovery/strain/sleep/RHR/HRV + 7-night sleep avg from /daily). Activity card shows Max HR/Strain from metrics. Attribution
  = one "Workouts synced from WHOOP" line (per WHOOP design guidelines / app approval). FFP_BUILD 454.
- **Cleanup (I-005):** deleted 3.5 MB footguns (.bak + versions/ dupe); extracted wearables logic to its own loader;
  trimmed the member-dashboard changelog header 174→29 lines.
- **STILL TO DO (this handoff):** auto-fill the manual Sleep Tracker from WHOOP daily sleep + a Recovery/Strain section in
  Fitness Stats (Bio tab). Verification note: the main test WHOOP account (whoop_user 1836269) is DORMANT with 2022-2023
  history → data looks old/scattered; a real active account (Sunjay 7117183) is the true test.

## ⏩ HANDOFF — last worked 2026-06-25 (Meetup AI search + quick-create · Pro notif-shadow fix)

**A. MEETUP AI (member app) — DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (FFP_BUILD bump) + `assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js` + backend `index.js`.**
- Lives in the meetup panel's EXISTING module `assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js` (one module per panel — NOT a separate
  file). v2 (2026-06-26, "Coach Grant"): (1) ONE search box — the EXISTING `#meet-search` IS the smart "find" (no
  second bar): type = the panel's live keyword filter (unchanged), press Enter = Coach Grant's best-matches ranking.
  (2) A "describe it → Coach Grant fills the form" field INSIDE the Post-a-meetup modal (`#pm-describe` / `pm-describe-go`).
  NO custom voice button — the device keyboard's own mic dictates. All assistance branded "Coach Grant" (no "AI Assistant").
- DESIGN (world-class/future-proof): the AI ONLY parses words → structured intent/draft (server). ALL ranking +
  ALL writes stay in deterministic, unit-tested code here + the canonical `host_meetup` RPC → no hallucinated
  results, model swappable by env. The module DECORATES `window.MeetMove` (wraps `.filtered`) + injects its own UI —
  ZERO edits to `ffp-connections-core.js` (fragile core untouched, reversible). Personalization ON: ranks using the
  member's own sport/level/city (`window.FFPAuth.getMember()` + `window.FFPCard`). Falls back to keyword search if AI off.
- BACKEND (Vercel — you deploy): extended `/api/ai/parse` with kinds `meetup_search` (→ `{intent}`) and
  `meetup_compose` (→ `{draft}`); reuses Haiku (`WORKOUT_MODEL`), existing auth + JSON parse. Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  (already set for workout/agent). Verified: route region parses in isolation; ranking unit-tested (past-excluded,
  best-match first, date-window narrowing). NOTE: the full-file `node --check` on `index.js` throws a FALSE error at the
  EOF email template (mount truncation) — the edited region is clean.
- Cache-bust: `FFP_BUILD` → **440** (busts the loader). Member-app change = its OWN task (Boundaries respected; member-facing only).

**B. PRO NOTIF-DRAWER SHADOW — DEPLOY: `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (PRO_BUILD 77→78).**
- The notifications drawer `.nt-menu` carried its `box-shadow` on the BASE rule, so even parked off-screen
  (`translateX(100%)`) it bled a grey vertical strip down the RIGHT edge of every page. Fix (root cause, one source):
  moved the shadow to `.nt-menu.show` (open state only).

**C. provider-signup → findfitpeople.com handoff — BUILT 2026-06-25. DEPLOY: backend `index.js` + NEW `auth-handoff.html`.**
- Booking chose the OAuth-style one-time code. NOTE: the pre-existing `/api/auth/exchange` only swapped a Supabase
  access_token (native OTP) — it did NOT cover this flow; `ffp-auth-exchange-test.html` tests that older path.
- Built (reuses the stateless-HMAC token pattern → NO new table): (1) `mintHandoffCode`/`verifyHandoffCode` (60s,
  signed with VERIFY_SECRET, URL-fragment only); (2) `/api/provider/signup` now returns `handoff_code`;
  (3) `/api/auth/exchange` accepts `{code}` → same `{jwt,refresh,member}` shape; (4) NEW `auth-handoff.html` receiver on
  ffppassport.com reads `#code&next`, exchanges, persists via **FFPAuth** (the dashboards' real auth store — NOT
  `supabase.auth.setSession` the booking doc assumed), clears the fragment, redirects.
- Verified: exchange route + helpers + receiver JS all parse in isolation. Booking side already wired
  (`goToDashboard` detects `handoff_code`) → they need NO change; confirmation relayed in `FFP-BOOKINGS.md`.
- Single-use nuance: code is STATELESS 60s (near-single-use; fragment-only + HTTPS). If strict single-use is required,
  add a one-row used-codes store (offered, not built). DEPLOY ORDER: backend first, then `auth-handoff.html`, then Booking repoints CTAs.

**D. ACTIVITY SHARE — TRANSPARENT STICKER (member app) — DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (FFP_BUILD 437→439).**
- The activity share sheet gains a "Transparent sticker" toggle: the card exports as a FULLY transparent PNG — NO
  panel / NO background, just the logo + activity + stats with a strong dark halo-shadow EDGE on the text so it stays
  legible over ANY photo (canvas 2D). Members save it and overlay it anywhere. Sticker overrides the photo-bg toggle;
  preview shows a checkerboard so the transparency is visible. (v363=438 first tried a frosted panel; Grant wanted it
  truly see-through → v363/439 removed the panel, shadow-edge only.)
- `_ffpMakeCardCanvas` gains a 4th `sticker` arg; `_ffpCurKey` + the export filename get a `-sticker` variant; new
  `window.ffpShareToggleSticker`. Verified by rendering the EXACT canvas code (transparent + legible on light AND dark).
  Member-app change = its OWN task (Boundaries; member-facing only).

**E. ASSISTANT REBRAND → "Grant" (pro + partner) — DEPLOY: `assets/ffp-agent.js` + `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`
(PRO_BUILD 78→79) + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` + backend `index.js`.**
- The shared in-dashboard assistant (was "FFP Coach" / "FFP Assistant" in `assets/ffp-agent.js`) is now **Grant** —
  the FAB aria-label is "Ask Grant", the panel title is "Grant" (sub "Grow your business — setup & day-to-day"), and
  the greeting is "I’m Grant… here to help you grow your coaching business / grow your business and promote your
  services". 503/unavailable message rebranded to Grant. Persona = Grant himself (it’s him helping users grow).
- Backend `agentSystem()` prompt (`index.js`): "You are FFP Coach…" → "You are Grant from FFP — a business coach…"
  with grow-the-business framing split by role (pro = grow coaching business; partner = improve business + promote
  services). Deploy backend to Vercel.
- Cache-bust: `assets/ffp-agent.js?v=4 → ?v=5` in BOTH dashboards; **PRO_BUILD 78→79** (the provider dashboard has no
  on-screen build stamp — the `?v=5` agent bump is its cache-bust). Member/meetup assistance is already "Coach Grant" (v364).

**F. MEMBER GROWTH BATCH (2026-06-26) — DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (FFP_BUILD 440→441) + backend `index.js` (Vercel).**
1. PASSPORT "Your trend" card under the World Map (v365): this-week vs last-week activity, day-streak, 8-week sparkline
   + a Coach Grant tip. `renderTrend()` computes from the global `LOGS` (all-time), called inside `renderAll()`.
2. EMAIL-VERIFIED indicator: the Profile email card shows "Verified ✓" (from `members.verified`). Backend
   `/api/auth/signin` now sets `verified:true` on a successful email-code login (the code proves the inbox). No gating.
3. SUNDAY SUMMARY personalized: the weekly cron generates a per-member "Grant's note" via Haiku (`WORKOUT_MODEL`,
   ~35 words from that member's week) and `renderSundaySummary` shows it as a yellow box under the greeting.
4. ADD-TO-HOME-SCREEN: `sendWelcomeEmail` gains an "Add FFP Passport to your home screen" section (iOS Share→Add;
   Android ⋮→Install), and signup fires an in-app `notifyMember` with the same tip (push fires once they enable it).
- Verified via real-file Reads — the bash mount serves a TRUNCATED copy of `index.js` (~3925 of 4046 lines) so a
  full-file `node --check` FALSE-fails at the cut; the edited regions are intact. Member-app + member-facing only.

**G. PASSPORT QR PAGE — FIX + UPGRADE (2026-06-26) — DEPLOY: `my-passport.html` + backend `index.js` (Vercel).**
- BUG: the member passport QR → `my-passport.html?p=FFP-YYYY-NNNN` called `GET /api/passport/:no` which **did NOT exist**
  → 404 → `res.json()` on the non-JSON 404 threw "The string did not match the expected pattern" (Safari) → "Network error".
- FIX: new backend `GET /api/passport/:passportNo` (placed before `/api/members/:id`) resolves passport_no → member public
  card fields + journey/streak stats (computed from `activity_logs`) + UPCOMING HOSTED meet-ups (`meetups.host_member_id`,
  status open/full, future). Public, read-only, public fields only (service-role read).
- UPGRADE (`my-passport.html` v4): keeps the EXACT static passport card (front); now adds a "<name>'s journey" strip
  (streak / activities / cities / places) + an "Upcoming meet-ups <name> is hosting" list + the existing
  Get-your-Passport CTA — "just enough to encourage a scanner to join". `renderCard(data)` takes `{member,stats,meetups}`.
- Verified via real-file Reads (bash mount truncates `index.js` and serves a stale `my-passport.html`). Deploy backend to Vercel.

**H. PARTNER OVERVIEW REBUILD + `provider_overview` RPC (2026-06-26) — DEPLOY: DB (RPC already applied live) + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`.**
- Research (small fitness-business KPIs): visit-frequency / ATTENDANCE is the #1 retention leading indicator
  (members visiting <4×/month ≈ 80% churn; 50% of quitters leave in the first 90 days). So the Overview leads with
  ENGAGEMENT, then business, and stays focused (not a wall of stats).
- NEW RPC `provider_overview(p_provider)` — SECURITY DEFINER + `assert_provider_owner`, APPLIED live via MCP. One call →
  members_total / members_new_7d, revenue_month_aed, appts_upcoming / appts_today, sessions_today, checkins_7d /
  checkins_prev_7d, active_members_7d, members_at_risk (last visit 14–60d ago), top_session, top_staff.
- Overview (`renderOverview` → new `provOverviewStats`): replaced the listing KPIs (active listings / claims / RSVPs)
  with clean BORDERLESS Engagement + Business stats + most-popular-session + most-active-staff + a real member-activity
  feed (`provider_recent_session_bookings`). No boxed KPI cards.
- DONE: Reviews → its OWN panel — NAV `reviews` item (Business section) + `panel-reviews` + `showPanel` route;
  `renderReviews` reuses `provider_rating` + `provider_reviews_list`; the rating card was removed from the Overview.
  Tabs filter the rendered rows client-side (via `data-stars`/`data-photo`): All / Top-rated / Needs attention / With
  photos. (Provider dashboard has no on-screen build stamp — redeploy the HTML.)

## ⏩ HANDOFF — read first (last worked: 2026-06-21, World-class forms + prose + preview + 16px)

**FORMS OVERHAUL (2026-06-21) — DB live; deploy 4 dashboards + bump PRO_BUILD 62 + 1 small BOOKING change.**
- New read-only field type **`statement`** = written prose the client reads (intro paragraphs, legal WARNING). Default
  waivers rebuilt around it so they read like real waivers, not just checkboxes. **Facility** waiver (providers) vs
  **Professional** waiver (pros) differ in wording. Comprehensive **PAR-Q** (13 conditions + intro prose + declaration).
  Forms only ask the GAPS (emergency contact, medical, consents, signature) — name/DOB/gender/nationality/email/phone
  come from the Passport. Seeds: `seed_default_form_templates` (providers) + `seed_default_pro_form_templates` (pros)
  redefined; all existing auto-seeded templates deactivated + re-seeded (assigned forms keep their own snapshot). Verified:
  every provider/pro has a 12-field waiver (3 prose blocks) + 19-field PAR-Q.
- **PREVIEW**: both builders (partner `cpPreview`/`_ffpFormPreview` in ffp-provider-dashboard.html; pro `afPreview`/
  `_ffpFormPreview` in ffp-professional-client-loader.js) now have a Preview button that renders exactly what the member
  sees (all field types incl. statement prose + signature). Builder renders a TEXTAREA for statement fields (single-line
  inputs strip newlines); `_cpRenderForms`/`afRender` skip statements in the completed-answers view.
- **16px iOS-zoom guard:** added `input,select,textarea,.input,.select,.textarea{font-size:16px!important}` to the
  **provider, professional and admin** dashboards (the management side). The member Passport app is SEPARATE (see
  Boundaries) — its 16px is the booking/Passport team's job, specced in FFP-BOOKINGS.md, NOT done here.
- ⚠️ BOOKING (1 small change — relay to booking team; statements currently render as a text input there until done):
  in `js/forms.js` — (a) `fieldInput`: `if(f.type==="statement"||f.type==="info") return "";`  (b) `fieldBlock`: 
  `if(f.type==="statement"||f.type==="info") return '<div style="font-size:13.5px;color:#3a4a4e;line-height:1.65;white-space:pre-wrap;margin:0 0 14px;">'+esc(f.label||"")+'</div>';`  (c) submit loop: skip statements
  (don't add to responsesOut, don't validate). member_get_form already returns the fields incl. statements — no DB change.
- DEPLOY: `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`, `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`, `ffp-professional-client-loader.js`,
  `ffp-member-dashboard.html`, `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (PRO_BUILD **62**).
- STILL TO DO (next): pro client profile redesign (passport-card flip + tap-to-email/call + 5 smaller buttons + recent
  note opposite) — task open, not started.

## ⏩ Prior handoff (2026-06-21, Stripe Connect reliability hardening)

**STRIPE CONNECT RELIABILITY (2026-06-21) — DB live; deploy backend + 2 dashboards + DO 1 Stripe-dashboard step.**
Why: status was set ONCE at onboarding return; if a connected partner later got restricted or payouts paused, we'd
still show 'connected' and keep sending customers into a checkout that fails. Now status stays truthful over time.
- DB (live, migration `connect_health_columns`): added `charges_enabled, payouts_enabled, requirements_due,
  disabled_reason, payments_updated_at` to BOTH `providers` and `professionals`.
- Backend `index.js` (deploy to Vercel): new `accountStatusPatch(acct)` (maps live Stripe account → status:
  connected / restricted [submitted but charges off] / onboarding) + `syncConnectAccount(acct)`; new webhook branch
  **`account.updated`** re-syncs the owning provider/pro; both `/connect/return` handlers now capture the full health
  (payouts + requirements), not just charges_enabled. The connected-account `checkout.session.completed` finalise
  branch already existed (idempotent, shared with /api/pay/confirm) — fulfillment no longer depends on the redirect
  **provided the webhook receives connected-account events** (see Stripe step below).
- Frontend: `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` `renderPaymentsCard()` + `ffp-professional-billing-loader.js` `_proStripeCard()`
  now render **restricted ("Action needed — payments paused", with requirement count → Resolve in Stripe)** and a
  **payouts-paused** banner on the connected state. Cache-bust **PRO_BUILD 60→61**.
- ⚠️ GRANT — ONE Stripe dashboard step (required for both reliability wins): on the webhook endpoint
  (Developers → Webhooks → your `/api/webhooks/stripe` endpoint): (1) add event **`account.updated`**, and
  (2) make sure the endpoint **listens to events on connected accounts** (the "Listen to events on Connected accounts"
  option / a Connect-type endpoint) so `checkout.session.completed` from a partner's account reaches us. Also add
  `checkout.session.completed` if not already subscribed. Without (2), redirect-independent fulfillment won't fire.
- DEPLOY: backend `index.js` (Vercel) + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` + `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` +
  `ffp-professional-billing-loader.js` (Netlify). Verified: helper logic unit-tested (connected/restricted/onboarding/
  payouts states + requirement de-dup), both card fns parse, DB cols present.

## ⏩ Prior handoff (2026-06-21, Pro client profile + booking strap + coach notes)

**PRO CLIENT PROFILE / BOOKING STRAP / COACH NOTES (2026-06-21) — DB live; deploy 3 files (PRO_BUILD 58→59).**
- BUG FIXED: Pro dashboard → Scheduling → tap a session → "Session options" → the "Booked in" client strap did
  **nothing**. Root cause: it called `clientProfile()` behind `if(window.clientProfile)`, but that fn lives in the
  lazy `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` which only loads for the Clients panel. New `openProClientProfile(id)` in
  `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` injects that loader on demand then opens; the Scheduling strap now calls it.
- `clientProfile` REBUILT world-class (in `ffp-professional-client-loader.js`): avatar+name+status header, info as a
  2-col GRID of cards (not one row per field), and square icon TILES (Connect Passport / Packages / Forms / Notes /
  Edit) instead of full-width button rows. It now self-loads `_members` (so it works when opened from Scheduling).
- NEW threaded COACH NOTES: DB `pro_client_notes` + RPCs `pro_list_client_notes` / `pro_add_client_note` /
  `pro_delete_client_note` (all `assert_pro_owner`, live). Notes tile on the profile opens a threaded add/list/delete modal.
- v60 tweak: client info shown as clean divider rows (no boxed/"box" cells); square action buttons kept; the **latest 3
  coach notes** now render on the profile under the buttons (View all → full thread).
- DEPLOY: `ffp-professional-client-loader.js`, `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js`, `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`
  (PRO_BUILD **60**). Confirm avatar menu shows Build 60, then Scheduling → session → tap a booked-in client → profile opens.

## ⏩ Prior handoff (2026-06-21, Pro forms system)

**PRO FORMS (2026-06-21) — DB already LIVE; one file to deploy.**
- DB (applied, migration `pro_forms_system`): tables `pro_form_templates` + `pro_client_forms` (mirror the provider
  forms tables); RPCs `pro_list_form_templates`, `pro_save_form_template`, `pro_delete_form_template`,
  `pro_list_client_forms`, `pro_assign_form`, `pro_complete_form_upload`, `pro_delete_client_form` (all `assert_pro_owner`).
  Seed `seed_default_pro_form_templates` + AFTER-INSERT trigger `trg_seed_forms_on_professional` + backfill — every pro
  now has 2 world-class templates (Liability Waiver & Assumption of Risk 9-field; Pre-exercise readiness PAR-Q+ 11-field).
  `member_forms_list` / `member_get_form` / `member_submit_form` were rewritten to **UNION** provider + pro forms, so the
  booking `forms.html` (js/forms.js, member RPCs, renders `f.provider`) surfaces pro forms with **NO booking change**.
  Pro completion notifies the pro owner (`professionals.member_id`); assign notifies member with link
  `findfitpeople.com/forms.html?form=<id>`.
- DEPLOY: `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` (the client-record "Forms" button — was the "Assessment form" placeholder —
  now opens assign / manage-templates / builder / upload-signed-copy / remove). Cache-bust = **PRO_BUILD 57→58** in
  `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (deploy that too). Confirm avatar menu shows **Build 58**, then open a client → Forms.

## ⏩ Prior handoff (last worked: 2026-06-18, Quests polish: card/preview height, partner filter, gender leaderboard)
**Deploy queue (Grant commits → Netlify; NOT yet confirmed live):**
1. `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` — **v9**: major (headline) card height 138px→276px (2×); Leaderboard **Filters button**
   (tune + count badge) → Location (Global/Country/City) **+ Gender (All/Men/Women)** chips that combine; CSS id
   `ffp-quests-v8-css`. ALSO NEW **qr_gps proof** (PROOF map entry + `doTask` branch: prompt code → capture GPS → complete).
2. `ffp-member-dashboard.html` — quests-core include bumped **?v=7 → ?v=9**; ALSO (a) Log Activity modal now clears
   Activity/Calories/Notes on each fresh open (bug: modal inherited the previous entry's values); (b) Challenges bottom-nav
   button hidden (`display:none`) — parked for future feature.
3. `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` — hero-image upload preview box height 150px→300px (2×); ALSO **qr_gps proof** in builder
   (PROOFS option "Scan QR + GPS", GPS row shows for it, radius defaults 250m).
4. `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` — `_lazyInit` cache-bust **v=59 → v=61**; ALSO Challenges sidebar link greyed-out +
   non-clickable + "Soon" tag (parked for future feature).
Deploy all 4, hard-refresh (Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-R). NOTE: prior `ffp-quests-core.js` commit was mislabelled "v5" on GitHub
but live behaviour proved v7 content was deployed — use accurate commit messages so the version log stops drifting.

**Already LIVE on DB (no deploy needed):** migrations `quests_feed_partner_hide_ended` (member_quests_feed partner branch
now filters `status<>'ended'` + active_to window — stops ended/member-created quests appearing under Partner) and
`quest_leaderboard_add_gender` (dropped the 2-arg + 5-arg overloads, recreated as ONE function
`quest_leaderboard(p_quest,p_limit,p_city,p_country,p_search,p_gender)` — single fn so no PostgREST overload ambiguity;
deployed client calling without p_gender still resolves). gender values in `members.gender` are 'Male'/'Female'.
Earlier (2026-06-17) still live: `quests_headline_flag_feed`, `quest_images_storage_policies_rebuild`, `quests_feed_major_minor_partner`.

**Verify after deploy:** (a) Member Passport → Quests → Major card is now noticeably taller; tap a quest → Leaderboard tab
→ **Filters** button opens panel with Location + Gender; combining (e.g. My city + Women) filters the board; badge shows
active-filter count. (b) Admin → Quests → Edit → hero-image box is taller (300px). (c) Partner quests section should no
longer show the ended "Fitness Class Quest" (verified: feed partner count = 0 for grant@findfitpeople.com).

**Open / next:** Quests Phase 3 (auto-rule engine for `proof_type='auto'` tasks from bookings/check-ins); Phase 4 remaining
(partner-dashboard task builder + unlock/QR UI `ffp-provider-quest-create-loader.js` + partner verify queue in Check-ins);
optional gamification next (completion burst animation, streaks, city→country→global ambassador tier badges — points + 
`ffp_global_leaderboard` already exist); currency Phase 3/4/5 (tasks #69/#70). Member-created exploration-quest code is
preserved in quests-core but intentionally NOT surfaced in the new UI.

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (66b, PRO_BUILD 50→51) — Payment now truly FORCES a package
- Grant's screenshot: the no-packages fallback dropped to a free-text box (didn't force a package). Removed that fallback. `openPaymentModal` now GATES when the pro has no packages → "Create a package first" modal (→ Go to Packages, which itself gates on a service). With packages, the dropdown requires picking one (or the in-list "Other / one-off"); `savePayment` already rejects an empty selection. Editing an existing record still allowed.

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (66) — Pro package payment now GRANTS the client their credits
- Grant: "purchase reflects credits for user." PRO `savePayment` (`ffp-professional-billing-loader.js`): recording a **real package** payment (not "Other / one-off", payment mode, new record) now also calls **`pro_assign_package`** → the client receives the package's credits in one step (a CLIENT is now required for a package payment). One-off charges still just record. Toast confirms "credits added to the client" (or guides to assign from Clients if the grant fails). PRO_BUILD 49→50.
- Partner side already did this — `provider_sell_package` (Packages → Sell) creates the client package with sessions. So both pro + partner now: package purchase = payment + credits. ("Parallel manual-payment ledger" = the pro's standalone Payments tab; partner uses Sell-package instead — not adding a separate partner ledger for now.)

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (65) — Catalog flow locked: Service → Package (required) → Payment (= package)
- Grant's model: **Service** = what the client does; **Package** = what they buy (bound to a service); **Payment** = a package purchase. Enforced order Service → Package → Payment.
- **Package now REQUIRES a service** (was optional both sides): PRO `openPlanModal` (`ffp-professional-client-loader.js`) — "For which service *" required, gate "Create a service first" → Services tab when none, `savePlan` rejects empty service. PARTNER `apPackageModal` (`ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js`) — Service * required (`_apServiceOpts(...,false)` drops "Any service"), toast-gate "Add a service first" when none, `apSavePackage` rejects empty service.
- **Payment = a PACKAGE purchase** (superseding 64's service-picker): pro Record-payment/Invoice picker is now the pro's **packages** (`_ensureBillPackages` → `pro_list_packages`; option carries name+price; pick → description=package name + auto-fill amount). Kept **"Other / one-off"** escape (Grant: "package or one-off"). No-packages → hint + plain description fallback. `ffp-professional-billing-loader.js`.
- Files: `ffp-professional-client-loader.js`, `ffp-professional-billing-loader.js`, `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (PRO_BUILD 48→49); `ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js`, `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (appointments loader ?v=9→10). Verified edited regions `node --check` OK.

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (64) — Payment "Description" → Service/product picker (money tied to the catalog)
- Grant: the Record-payment Description should be a SERVICE the pro created (in Services tab) first, not free text. `ffp-professional-billing-loader.js`: `openPaymentModal` now loads the pro's services (`_ensureBillServices` → `pro_list_services`) and renders a **"Service / product" `<select>`** (each option carries name + price). Picking one sets the (hidden) description = service name and auto-fills Amount from the service price (editable). An **"Other / one-off…"** option reveals a free-text box for ad-hoc charges. If the pro has NO services yet → inline hint to add one in the Services tab + a plain description box fallback. `savePayment` validates a service (or Other) is chosen. Applies to both Payment + Invoice modes. PRO_BUILD 46→47.
- **(64b, PRO_BUILD 47→48) Service REQUIRED for slots.** `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js`: opening "New slot" with ZERO services now shows a **"Create a service first"** gate (→ Go to Services tab) instead of the form; the Service field is marked required (*); `saveSlot` rejects an empty service. A slot must reference a service (price/duration/cancellation policy come from it). Editing an existing slot still allowed.

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (63) — #42 RPC ownership hardening: Phase 0 + Phase 1 money-critical (DONE + verified)
- **KEY finding:** the "auth.uid() is always null" note in this file is STALE. `assets/ffp-api-integration.js` v12 injects the member's signed Supabase JWT on every request, so `auth.uid()` resolves to the logged-in member on ALL dashboards (member/pro/provider). Confirmed live via `whoami()` on the pro dashboard: `role:authenticated`, real `uid`, and `pro_id`/`provider_id` both resolve (professionals.member_id / providers.owner_user_id are the ownership links). → the systemic fix is small in-DB guards, NOT a backend re-route.
- **Phase 0 (live):** helpers `assert_pro_owner(p_pro)` / `assert_provider_owner(p_provider)` — raise 'forbidden' unless `auth.role()='service_role'` (backend, exempt) OR caller owns the host id (`auth.uid()`) OR `is_admin()`. Plus `whoami()` diagnostic. VERIFIED with simulated JWTs: non-owner→rejected, owner→allowed (both pro + provider).
- **Phase 1 (live) — credits & payments, the actual free-credit hole — 16 funcs guarded:** grant/sell/assign/save: `pro_assign_package`, `provider_sell_package`, `provider_assign_plan`, `pro_save_package`, `provider_save_plan`, `provider_save_package`; money-movement: `pro_refund_booking` (+resilient owner check), `provider_refund_booking` (+credit-booking guard), `provider_session_add_member` (+stamps credit_source_id), `pro_mark_paid`, `provider_mark_paid`, `pro_cancel_client_package`, `provider_cancel_member_plan`, `pro_return_credit`, `provider_return_credit`, `provider_session_remove_member`. Each now `perform assert_*_owner(...)` first.
- **Phase 2 high-value (live):** owner-guarded `pro_delete_slot`, `pro_cancel_occurrence`, `pro_reschedule_occurrence`, `provider_cancel_session`, `provider_save_session_template`, `provider_delete_session_template`; MEMBER self-booking guard added to `book_session` + `pro_book_slot` (non-service-role must have `auth.uid()=p_member`). **Total now 24 functions hardened (9 pro + 13 provider owner-guards + 2 member-self) — verified count via pg_proc.** ALL money-movement + host cancel/reschedule + member self-booking are now caller-verified.
- **STILL TO DO (lower risk — griefing/privacy, NOT money; mechanism proven):** (tasks #43–45) Phase 2 config mutations (`pro_save_slot`/`set_slot_status`, `provider_save_session`/`add_oneoff`/`delete_session`/`generate_class_sessions`/`class_session_*`, appointments book/cancel/reschedule/confirm/no_show/checkin, `*_save/delete_service`, `*_save/delete_client`/`member`, broadcasts/staff/teams/quests, `pro/provider_delete_package`, `provider_delete_plan`, `*_save/delete_payment`); CHECK-INS (analyse caller first: `pro_checkin_service` is MEMBER-initiated → guard `auth.uid()=p_me`; `pro_checkin_member`/`provider_checkin_*` are HOST-initiated → owner-guard); Phase 3 PRIVATE READS (client lists, client passports, rosters, payments, business reports) — DATA-LEAK risk. ⚠️ For reads: do NOT guard the member-facing ones the booking platform uses — build the allowlist from `FFP Booking Platform/js/ffp.js` (getProServices/getProSchedule/getProviderSessions/etc.) FIRST.
- All DB-side, live immediately, reversible. No dashboard/backend change.

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (62) — BOOKING-LOOP AUDIT (3 parallel agents) + first wave of money/comms fixes
- **Audited the whole loop** (pro/partner/client) across DB RPCs + both dashboards + the booking platform. Corrected a FALSE alarm: `mark_booking_paid`/`grant_member_plan`/`grant_pro_package` are **service_role-only** (verified grants) — NOT an anon exploit.
- **FIXED this turn (DB live):**
  1. **Credit returns went to the WRONG package/plan + weren't idempotent.** `pro_return_credit`/`provider_return_credit`/`provider_session_remove_member` ignored the booking's `credit_source_id` and credited an arbitrary package; idempotency was a free-text note. Now: return to the EXACT `credit_source_id`, `for update` lock + new typed `bookings.credit_returned_at` flag, ownership via stamped professional_id (resilient), notify member. (migration `credit_return_to_exact_source_idempotent`)
  2. **Host cancellation now auto-compensates + notifies.** `pro_cancel_occurrence` + `provider_cancel_session` previously cancelled the member's booking but returned NOTHING and sent NO notification. Now they loop affected bookings: auto-return the credit to its source plan/package (host-cancel = always compensate), and insert a member notification (credit returned / refund processing). (migration `host_cancel_autocompensate_and_notify`)
  3. **Reschedule now notifies + moves the booking.** `pro_reschedule_occurrence` was silent and left the member's booking time stale. Now it updates affected bookings' `scheduled_at` (so "my bookings" + the resilient schedule match stay correct) and notifies each member. (migration `pro_reschedule_notify_and_move_bookings`)
  4. **Member EMAILS for booking-critical events.** New `member_notify_email_payload` RPC + `trg_notification_member_email` trigger → emails the member (via `/api/notifications/email-member`, same secret/pipeline) for: Session cancelled / rescheduled / time changed / Credit returned / Booking cancelled. Backend `index.js`: `sendMemberNotifyEmail()` + endpoint added (DEPLOY with the existing `BOOKINGS_NOTIFY_SECRET`).
- **FIXED next (DB live, this session):**
  - **#39 partner template orphaning** — `provider_save_session_template`/`provider_delete_session_template` now PRESERVE any occurrence with a live booking (delete/regenerate only UNBOOKED future occurrences; insert guarded by NOT EXISTS so a preserved occurrence isn't duplicated). Members keep their seat + booking link. (migration `provider_template_preserve_booked_occurrences`)
  - **#41 race + duplicate** — `pro_book_slot` now `FOR UPDATE`-locks the slot + rejects a duplicate (same member, same occurrence); `book_session` got the same per-member duplicate guard (it already locked the occurrence). (migrations `pro_book_slot_lock_and_dup_guard`, `book_session_dup_guard`)
  - **#40 check-in double-consume** — `pro_checkin_service`/`pro_checkin_member` now consume a credit ONLY for true walk-ins: if the member already has a credit-paid booking for that pro+service within ±12h, check-in skips consumption. Also added the missing 2h re-checkin throttle to `pro_checkin_member`. Credit consumption is now exactly-once. (migration `checkin_skip_consume_when_booked`)
- **STILL OPEN — #42 (SYSTEMIC, security, needs planning):** pro/provider RPCs are anon-callable with explicit p_pro/p_provider and NO caller→owner verification (FFP uses its own JWT, so `auth.uid()` is null → RLS can't bind). Worst: `pro_assign_package`/`provider_sell_package` (anon-granted) = a client could grant themselves credits. Proper fix = route host mutations through the authenticated backend (verify FFP token → ownership) OR give hosts a real Supabase auth session. NOT a quick migration — recommend a dedicated planned pass before doing it (touches every host RPC). Do NOT attempt blind.
- Files: DB migrations (live) + `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js` (deploy). Email pipeline verified live earlier (200/401).

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (61) — Issue-1 traced: "auto-added as standing client" = the recurring-clients tick (now clarified)
- **Investigated the external booking platform** (`C:\Users\User\Documents\Claude\Projects\FFP Booking Platform`, now connected): it books via `FFP.bookAndPaySlot → pro_book_slot` (correct — creates a `bookings` row, NOT a standing client). DB audit: the ONLY function that inserts into `pro_slot_clients` is `pro_save_slot` (the pro's own slot form / "Add or remove people"). `pro_book_slot`'s match was a false positive (it only READS pro_slot_clients for capacity). **So no booking flow auto-adds anyone** — the only way a member becomes a STANDING (every-week) client is the pro ticking them in the slot form, which the UI didn't make obvious was recurring.
- **Cleanup:** removed Grant's stray standing-client row (was on PT 20:30 slot `61491e2a`); 0 remaining.
- **Fix (clarity, `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js`):** "Who's in this slot" → **"Recurring clients"** with a clear note in BOTH the slot create/edit form and the "Add or remove people" modal: ticking adds the person to EVERY week (standing/recurring); members who book a single session appear automatically and must NOT be added here. PRO_BUILD 45→46.
- Files: `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` + `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (PRO_BUILD 46). DB cleanup (1 row).
- Email pipeline VERIFIED live post-deploy: net.http_post → `/api/bookings/notify-host` returns 200 `{skipped:no_payload}` (correct secret) and 401 (wrong secret).

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (60) — Bookings made resilient (self-describing) — survive slot/session regeneration
- **World-class pattern: a booking is now an immutable record of its facts, not a fragile pointer to a slot.** Added `bookings.professional_id` + `bookings.service_id` (provider_id already existed) + indexes (`idx_bookings_professional`, `idx_bookings_provider_type`, `idx_bookings_item`). Backfilled all existing pro bookings (0 null professional_id) from the slot, with a credit-source fallback for orphaned ones.
- **Stamp at creation:** `pro_book_slot` now writes `professional_id` + `service_id` on both insert paths (credit + pending).
- **Resilient resolution (slot-id independent):**
  - `pro_week_schedule` matches member bookings by **(item_id = slot_id) OR (professional_id + occurrence date + start_time)** — so a booking still appears even after the slot is regenerated with a new id. VERIFIED: set a booking's item_id to all-zeros → it STILL shows "Grant Hermanus Goes" on the 07:00 slot.
  - `booking_host_notify_payload` now resolves the host from the **stamped `professional_id`/`provider_id`** (slot fallback only for label) → orphan-proof. This also FIXED the pro email payload that was returning null before (it depended on the now-regenerated slot). VERIFIED: returns Sunjay/PT Session/Mon 29 Jun 07:00.
- This is the permanent root-cause fix for the orphaning behind LATEST (59)/(58). Partner side: `provider_id` already stamped + `provider_session_roster` reads bookings; provider occurrence-regeneration is a lower risk (same pattern can be applied if needed).
- **All DB-side (migrations LIVE). No dashboard redeploy needed for this round.** (The booking EMAIL still needs the earlier backend deploy + `BOOKINGS_NOTIFY_SECRET` env from LATEST 58.) Open follow-up: issue-1 standing-client auto-add (likely the external findfitpeople.com booking platform).

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (59) — Pro slot delete-protection + restored Grant's orphaned booking (+ issue-1 findings)
- **(Issue 2) Pro could delete a slot members were booked into — no block, no notify → orphaned the booking.** Root cause was `pro_delete_slot` hard-deleting the slot (and the prior slot regeneration is what orphaned Grant's 29-Jun booking). **Fix (migration `pro_delete_slot_block_when_booked`):** the RPC now RETURNS FALSE (no delete) if any upcoming non-cancelled `bookings` reference the slot. Frontend `endSlot()` (ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js) now detects `data===false` and tells the pro to "Block this date" + refund first (the proper `pro_cancel_occurrence` flow already notifies + offers refunds). `pro_set_slot_status` only does active/paused (no 'ended'), so delete was the only destructive path. PRO_BUILD 44→45.
- **Restored Grant's orphaned 29-Jun 07:00 PT booking:** its `item_id` pointed at the deleted slot `d5c5691b`; re-pointed to the live Monday-07:00 PT slot `452b4fa3`. Verified it now shows "Grant Hermanus Goes" in Sunjay's week.
- **(Issue 1 — auto-added to a slot) findings, NOT yet fixed:** Grant is a STANDING client (`pro_slot_clients`) on slot `61491e2a` (PT 20:30) that he never booked via the Passport. The pro dashboard's slot create/edit form in THIS repo pre-checks NOTHING for a new slot and only standing clients on edit — so the auto-add is NOT coming from here. Most likely the external **findfitpeople.com booking platform** (separate site, not in this repo) adds members to `pro_slot_clients` on booking instead of creating a `bookings` row — OR it was a manual add. Need the exact repro / the booking-platform code to fix. (Did NOT delete the row — may be intentional.)
- **Root cause still open (flagged earlier): slot regeneration orphans bookings.** Stamp `professional_id`/`service_id`/date on `bookings` at creation so they survive slot id changes. Recommended next.
- Files: `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` + `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (PRO_BUILD 45) + DB migration + 1 data fix.

## LATEST 2026-06-21 (58) — Booking flow: 3 money-critical bugs fixed (credit cross-service, pro/partner not notified, bookings not on dashboard)
- **(BUG 1) PT credits paid for Tabata.** Root cause: `pro_assign_package` (manual assign-to-client) inserted `pro_client_packages` WITHOUT `service_id` (grant_pro_package already copied it). NULL service = "any service" in `pro_consume_package_credit`. **Fix (migration `pro_assign_package_bind_service_and_backfill`):** assign now copies `v.service_id`; backfilled all client packages from their `package_id` template (0 left unbound). Grant's "10 PT Session" now bound to PT Session → can't pay for Tabata.
- **(BUG 2) Booking didn't show on the pro dashboard (real-time).** `pro_week_schedule` built each slot's `clients` ONLY from `pro_slot_clients` (standing) — never read `bookings`. **Fix (migration `pro_week_schedule_include_member_bookings`):** clients now UNION standing clients + member self-bookings for that occurrence (matched on the pro's tz). Verified: Grant's Mon 29 Jun 07:00 PT booking now shows "Grant Hermanus Goes". (Partner: `provider_session_roster` already reads bookings, so per-session rosters were fine.)
- **(BUG 3) Pro/partner not notified.** PRO: `pro_book_slot` now inserts a `notifications` row for the pro's `professionals.member_id` (credit + pending paths) → shows in the pro bell (it reads /api/notifications/{member_id}). PARTNER: the provider bell is client-synthesized (RSVPs/applications/approvals) and didn't read bookings — added RPC `provider_recent_session_bookings(provider)` + wired it into `ffp-provider-notifications-loader.js` (v2→3) "New booking — X booked 'Session'". Verified RPC returns Grant's Hot Yoga/Beach Workout.
- **Cleanup (migration `cleanup_grant_tabata_credit_refund`):** cancelled the wrong Tabata booking (`f7a3fb7c`), deleted its `pro_package_uses` row, returned the credit (7→**8**). Kept the legit 29 Jun PT booking.
- **EMAIL to pro/partner — BUILT (Grant approved).** Enabled `pg_net` (migration `enable_pg_net_*`). New RPC `booking_host_notify_payload(booking)` resolves host email/name + member + session label + when (pro: `pro_slots→professionals`, work_email → fallback pro's member email; partner: `providers.contact_email` → fallback `owner_user_id` member email). Trigger `trg_booking_host_email` AFTER INSERT on bookings (professional/provider_session, confirmed|pending) → `net.http_post` to backend `/api/bookings/notify-host` with `x-ffp-secret`. Backend (index.js): new `sendBookingHostEmail()` (branded) + endpoint that verifies the secret, calls the RPC, emails. **Fires at insert time (slot exists then) so it resolves even though some OLD bookings are orphaned (below).**
  - **DEPLOY:** (1) commit/deploy backend `index.js` to Vercel; (2) set Vercel env **`BOOKINGS_NOTIFY_SECRET=ffp_bkn_7Qx2Lm9Vt4Rp8Wc1Zk6Hn3Yd5Bg0Js`** (must match the trigger). DB side is LIVE.
- **⚠️ NEW ISSUE FOUND (separate, important): slot regeneration ORPHANS bookings.** Grant's 29-Jun PT booking `item_id=d5c5691b` no longer matches a live `pro_slots` row (now `452b4fa3`) — the pro's slots were regenerated with new ids, so the booking points at a dead slot. Effect: such bookings vanish from `pro_week_schedule` (matched on slot_id) AND can't resolve a host. FIX NEEDeD: stamp `professional_id`/`provider_id` + `service_id` + occurrence date on `bookings` at creation (so schedule/payload resolve without the slot), or keep slot ids stable across edits. Not yet done — flagged to Grant.
- Files: DB migrations (LIVE) + `ffp-provider-notifications-loader.js` + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (loader ?v=2→3) + `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js` (deploy + env). Pro/member dashboards need NO redeploy (DB-side).

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (57) — Log Activity photo: clearer crop + ratio picker (square/portrait/landscape/wide/free)
- Shared crop modal `assets/ffp-image-upload.js` (v7→v8). New **opt-in `pickRatio`**: shows a ratio bar (Square 1:1 / Portrait 4:5 / Landscape 4:3 / Wide 16:9 / Free) with proportional icons → `cropper.setAspectRatio`; lets the user choose orientation (the "landscape/portrait" ask). Clearer crop frame (`guides/center/highlight/modal:true` = rule-of-thirds grid + dimmed surround) + hint "Drag to reposition · scroll/pinch to zoom". On save, when `pickRatio`, output size is derived from the actual crop box (long side capped to the caller's budget) so portrait/landscape aren't squashed to a fixed box. Other callers (provider/admin uploads) unchanged — pickRatio defaults false. New `FFPUpload._ratio`.
- `ffpLogPickPhoto` now passes `pickRatio:true`, default `aspect 4/3`, `outW/outH 1280` (budget). Files: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (FFP_BUILD 401→402, img-upload include ?v=7→8), `assets/ffp-image-upload.js`. Verified edited blocks via Read (full-file node --check is mount-truncation, RULE 3); crop UI confirmed in a render.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (56) — Passport panel: tap card = FLIP to back; share moved to a text link
- **Tap the passport now FLIPS to the back** (was: tap = share). Wrapped the bespoke front `.pass-shell` in the canonical flip structure (`.ffp-pc-flip` > `.ffp-pc-face.ffp-pc-front` + new `.ffp-pc-back#pass-self-back`), added `.pass-container{perspective}` + `.pass-container.flipped .ffp-pc-flip{rotateY(180)}` (reuses the global `.ffp-pc-*` face/backface rules → no bleed). New `ffpFlipSelfPassport()` builds the back on each flip via **`FFPPassportCard.backShell(FFPCard.resolve(selfId))`** (activities + level + stats — same back used in the deck/match cards; RULE 5 reuse). `scalePassportCard()` now scales BOTH faces' `.pass-shell`.
- **Share moved to a link:** the grey "Tap your passport to share…" text → blue underlined link **"Tap here to share your passport with friends"** with `onclick=sharePassportCard()`. (Share still works; `prerenderPassportShare` clones the first `.pass-shell` = front, unaffected.)
- **Files:** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` only (FFP_BUILD **398→399**). Verified: flip JS `node --check` OK; flip + back + share-link confirmed in a show_widget render.
- **(56c, Build 401) FIX — skill meter bars all showed 1 line:** `FFPPassportCard.meter()` mapped an OLD taxonomy (`not tried/social/competitive/representative/professional`); the live levels are **Just started 1 / Recreational 2 / Skilled 3 / Highly skilled 4 / Professional 5**. Updated the idx to those 5 + kept legacy fallbacks (DB has a mix: social/competitive/representative still present). Shared `meter()` → fixes bars on every card. `ffp-member-dashboard.html`, FFP_BUILD 400→401.
- **(56b, Build 400) FIX — back showed "No activities logged yet":** self's skills live in `members.skills` but the anon client can't read `members` (RLS `auth.uid()=id` → null) and the boot/localStorage payload didn't carry skills, so `FFPCard.fromProfile().sports` was empty. Now `ffpEnsureSelfSkills()` fetches self through the **`members_cards(p_ids)`** SECURITY-DEFINER RPC (same one the deck/connection cards use — returns skills), maps it (`_ffpSelfCard`), syncs `MemberProfile.data.sports`, and `ffpRenderSelfBack()` renders the canonical back from it (re-renders once the fetch resolves; cached after). Verified RPC returns Grant's 5 skills+levels.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (55) — Profile > Preferences: removed the duplicate "Notifications" checkbox
- The top **"Phone notifications" card** (Web Push, `ffpToggleNotifications`) is the single notifications control. Removed the redundant `Notifications` `pref-toggle` checkbox from the Preferences list (renderProfile). Kept Weekly Newsletter / Public Profile / Hide DOB. `d.preferences.notifications` field left in the data model (inert; no longer surfaced). `ffp-member-dashboard.html`, FFP_BUILD **397→398**.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (54) — Calorie Tracker: bigger tabs, de-boxed chips, goal timeframe → DATE
- **Tabs 2× bigger:** `.fp-tab` 13px→20px (gap 18→26).
- **De-boxed (Grant: "no need for everything to have a box"):** `.food-picker-cat`, `.meal-type-chip`, `.goal-config-pill` → transparent, no border/radius; active = blue text + 2px underline (matches the timer-preset treatment). `.goal-config-result` → no yellow box, just a top divider.
- **Goal timeframe → target DATE (no drift):** added `profile_meta.target_date` (migration `profile_meta_add_target_date`, LIVE). Goal modal "Timeframe (weeks)" stepper replaced by an "Achieve by" `<input type=date>`. `target_date` is source of truth; `targetWeeks` derived (`_weeksUntil`) so the kcal math is unchanged (and tightens correctly as the date nears). Plan text + Today goal-pill now read "… by 14 Sep 2026". Loader loads `target_date` (falls back to deriving from legacy `target_weeks`) and saves it. `adjGoal` no longer touches the removed `gc-weeks`.
- **Files:** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (FFP_BUILD **396→397**, core include **?v=2→3**), `ffp-calorie-tracker-core.js` (**v2→v3**: targetDate + date helpers `_isoToday/_weeksUntil/_isoFromWeeks/_goalIso/_dateLabel/setTargetDate`; openGoalConfig/adjGoal/renderGoalConfigResult/pill rewired), `ffp-calorie-tracker-loader.js` (**v7→v8**: load+save target_date). DB: `profile_meta.target_date` added. Verified: edited JS slices `node --check` OK.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (53) — FIX: Workout Timer seconds wheels were 5s steps — now 1-second (Countdown + EMOM)
- Grant (twice) wanted 1-second increments. cdSec/emSec were still `step:5` → fixed to `step:1` (max 55→59). Interval was already 1s. `ffp-member-dashboard.html`, FFP_BUILD **395→396**.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (52) — Calorie Tracker: smoother add-food + create-meal (decluttered the food area)
- **Grant:** add-food/add-meal wasn't smooth; too many numbers/bits around the add area. Wanted a clean button → modal to select/search food, and a modal to create meals that go to a list. Confirmed via AskUserQuestion: **one-tap add at default serving (adjust after)** + **auto-assign meal by time of day (movable)**.
- **Today screen:** removed the My Meals horizontal bucket-chip strip + the single "Log food" button → now **two clean buttons: "Add food" (opens picker) and "Create meal" (opens existing FFPMyMeals builder).** Hero ring + macros kept (the dashboard).
- **Add-food picker (one-tap):** new **Foods | My meals tabs**. Each food row has a **＋** that adds instantly at default serving into the **auto (time-of-day) bucket** and stays open (tick feedback, toast); tapping the food **name** opens the amount-adjust modal. "My meals" tab = clean vertical list of saved meals (no bucket chips), tap = log to auto bucket, small × deletes.
- **Adjust modal decluttered:** the 4-box macro grid collapsed to one line (big kcal · NpNcNf); meal chips default to the auto bucket so it's movable.
- **Reused, not reinvented (RULE 5):** create-meal = existing `mmOpenBuilder`; time-of-day = existing `mmDefaultBucket`; persistence = existing `confirmAdd` override (food_logs) + `member_meal_log`.
- **Files:** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (FFP_BUILD **394→395**, calorie-core include **?v=1→2**), `assets/ffp-calorie-tracker-core.js` (**v1→v2**: `quickAdd/autoBucket/setPickerTab/_pickerTab`, food-row ＋, pickFood auto-bucket), `assets/ffp-calorie-tracker-loader.js` (**v6→v7**: renderMyMeals→`#fp-mymeals-list`, mmLog auto-bucket, `FFPMyMeals.refresh`). Verify: both JS slices `node --check` OK (full-file checks are mount-truncation false positives per RULE 3). No DB changes.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (51) — Workout Timer per-mode fixes (wheel centring bug + countdown/interval/EMOM rework)
- **Wheel centring bug fixed (the "top white" Grant saw):** wheel had no padding, so the selected number sat at the TOP of the 3-row viewport, not centre. `.timer-wheel` now `box-sizing:content-box; height:44px; padding:44px 0` (border-box 132 = 3 rows) so `scrollTop = i*ROW` truly centres item i; added top/bottom **mask fade** + dimmer neighbours (#33424f) and a bigger pure-white centre (`.sel` 30px #fff). Centre selection lines moved to 18% inset.
- **Stopwatch:** new `#panel-workout-timer.mode-stopwatch .timer-display-v2{margin-top:16vh}` (class toggled in `applyMode`) — display drops toward centre since stopwatch has no setup below.
- **Countdown:** quick picks 10→**5** (30s/1m/3m/5m/10m); wheels now **single-digit** (removed `pad:true` on cdMin/cdSec).
- **Interval:** work/rest now **1-second** increments (step 5→1, max 600→300); rounds **max 30** (was 50).
- **EMOM reworked:** dropped "beep every" presets + **Reps**; now three wheels **Minutes : Seconds · Rounds**. State `emInterval/emReps` → **`emMin/emSec`** (default 1:00); `phaseDurMs = max(5, emMin*60+emSec)*1000` (0:00 guard); meta "Round X of Y · every M:SS"; removed the em-interval-presets listener in `init`. (`adj()` stepper handler now fully dead — left inert.)
- Verified: WorkoutTimer `node --check` SYNTAX OK; no live `emInterval/emReps` refs (only in dead `adj()`); wheel centring + all 4 mode layouts confirmed in show_widget render.
- Files: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` only (**FFP_BUILD 393→394**).

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (50) — Workout Timer redesign BUILT (scroll wheels, 8s get-ready, status 3×, time-as-hero, boxless)
- **In `ffp-member-dashboard.html` `WorkoutTimer` (the real object, not a mock).** Grant's 4 asks all built + verified in a render:
  1. **Status 3× larger:** `.timer-phase` 11px→**34px** (letter-spacing 2.5→1, nowrap). New `.phase-getready` (gold).
  2. **8-second GET READY lead-in** before Countdown/Interval/EMOM (NOT stopwatch). New state fields `getready/getreadyEnd/getreadyRemain/getreadyLast`; `start()` enters it when `phase==='ready' && mode!=='stopwatch'`; `tick()` counts 8→1 as the big number, beeps at 3/2/1, then `beginPhase()`. Pause mid-lead-in stores remaining; resume continues.
  3. **Scroll-wheel pickers replace ALL +/- steppers** (taps caused iOS zoom). New `buildWheels()/_wheel*` suite: snap-scroll columns, centred value = `.sel` (big), thin centre selection lines, **boxless**. Keys cdMin/cdSec/intWork/intRest/intRounds/emRounds/emReps. `this.s[key]` stays source of truth (engine unchanged downstream); presets reposition wheels via `renderAdjusters()→_wheelTo`; `applyMode()` repositions on mode switch (scrollTop needs visible element). `adj()` now dead (kept, harmless).
  4. **Time is the hero while running:** `#panel-workout-timer.timing` hides `#timer-tabs` + `#timer-config-area`; `.timing .timer-meta` 22px/900 uppercase = bigger ROUND line. Class added in `start()`, removed in `reset()`.
- Also: **boxless** `.timer-preset-btn` (transparent, active=blue underline) + `.timer-input-group` (no bg/border); **Interval summary line** `#int-summary` ("N rounds · Xs work / Ys rest"); removed the "flick each wheel" hint.
- Verified: WorkoutTimer object extracted + `node --check` = SYNTAX OK; wheel flick/snap + all 3 states confirmed in show_widget render.
- Files: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` only (**FFP_BUILD 392→393**). No DB/loader changes.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (49) — Tier AUTO-EVALUATION wired (earn + maintain over rolling 30 days) — money/status-sensitive
- **Engine (migration `member_tier_auto_evaluate_engine`, LIVE):** `member_evaluate_tier(p_member, p_commit default true)` computes tier from `member_tier_progress` (rolling 30d): counts categories at each level (targets mirror Earnings.categories: referred 2/8, connections 2/8, meetups 1/4, providers 2/8, quest-tasks 4/10, events 1/4, activities 8/24, social 10/30) → **ambassador if ≥4 cats at amb level, supporter if ≥4 at sup level, else member.** `member_evaluate_all_tiers(p_commit)` = bulk sweep. p_commit=false = dry-run.
- **Safety / maintain rule:** qualify ≥ current → grant earned + set `tier_expires_at = greatest(existing, now()+30d)` (never shortens a longer/Founding expiry). Slip below current → KEEP until `tier_expires_at` passes (grace), then demote (member→null expiry). **Founding/manual ambassadors (future expiry) are never auto-demoted.**
- **Verified (dry-run on all):** promoted 0, demoted 0, maintained 5, grace 11 → committing now is a NO-OP (nobody yet qualifies for promotion; all 11 ambassadors future-dated Aug–Dec 2026 → grace). Baseline committed.
- **Scheduled:** pg_cron job **`ffp-member-tier-daily`** (jobid 4) `17 3 * * *` → `member_evaluate_all_tiers(true)`. Plus **on-demand**: `loadTierStats` (Earnings open) calls `member_evaluate_tier(self, true)` and persists the result so `computedTier()` shows it live. computedTier comment updated (no longer "parked").
- **Text fix:** reqLine/reqHighlight "4 of 7 categories" → **"4 of 8"**.
- Files: `assets/ffp-earnings-core.js`, `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (earnings-core **?v=2→3**, **FFP_BUILD 391→392**). DB + cron live.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (48) — Quest task straps: fixed nested-scroll + multiple-open + no clip
- **Root cause of "straps not showing correctly":** `.q-tasklist` had `max-height:54vh; overflow:auto` — a nested scroll INSIDE the already-scrolling detail modal, cramming the tasks into a small sub-window instead of one long list. Removed it → the task list flows full-height and the modal scrolls the long list (what Grant wants).
- `toggleTask` rewritten to `row.classList.toggle('open')` — **multiple straps open at once** (was force-closing the others). All tasks shown, done stay visible (unchanged). `.q-task.open .q-task-d` max-height 360→**620px** so expanded body doesn't clip.
- Files: `assets/ffp-quests-core.js`; `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (quests-core **?v=9→10**, **FFP_BUILD 390→391**). (Existing strap styling kept; mock-style proof chips are a further optional restyle.)

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (47) — Progression: "Quest tasks" counts quest TASKS (not whole quests) + modals show current count + Earnings-log font
- **"Quest tasks" count (was wrong):** `member_tier_progress` `quests_completed` counted whole `quest_progress` (status='completed') — so finishing individual quest tasks never moved it. Now counts **`quest_task_completions`** (status in 'verified'/'completed', within 30d via `coalesce(verified_at,submitted_at,created_at)`). Both overloads, migration `tier_progress_count_quest_tasks_not_quests`, LIVE + verified (Grant shows 1). Category relabelled "Tasks completed" → **"Quest tasks"** in `ffp-earnings-core.js` (key stays `quests_completed`; thresholds 4/10).
- **Section-info modals now show current count:** new `#si-current` row in the modal; `openSectionInfo` sets "You've completed X so far — N more to reach Ambassador" for EVERY category.
- **Earnings-log font fix:** `.ffp-po-title`/`.ffp-po-subtitle` CSS was scoped only to `#ffp-payouts-section`, so the Earnings-log title/subtitle were unstyled. Broadened the selectors to `#ffp-earnings-log` too (title 14px/800; subtitle 11px muted small). `ffp-earnings-loader.js`.
- Files: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (**FFP_BUILD 389→390**, earnings-core **?v=1→2**, `#si-current`), `assets/ffp-earnings-core.js`, `assets/ffp-earnings-loader.js`. DB live.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (46) — Pull-to-refresh: switched member dashboard to inner-scroll so the gesture works (incl. iOS/standalone)
- **Why:** PTR (build 387) listened on the DOCUMENT scroll, but on iOS the body overscroll is owned by the OS (Safari tab) / behaved unreliably (standalone), and `overscroll-behavior` can't disable it on body. Fix = scroll an INNER container so the page never overscrolls and our handler owns the gesture.
- **Structural change (low-risk — `.content` already wraps all panels, static block):** `body { overflow:hidden }` (was overflow-x); `.content` is now the scroller — `height:100dvh; overflow-y:auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch; overscroll-behavior-y:contain` (kept its 76/80 padding + max-width 880 + margin auto, so layout unchanged; topbar/bottom-nav stay fixed over it). NOTE for future: the member app now scrolls `.content`, NOT the document.
- `_ffpInitPullToRefresh` `atTop()` now reads `.content`.scrollTop; indicator repositioned to drop below the 60px topbar (top:64, translateY -90→0). All `window.scrollTo(0,0)` (panel switches, notif routing) → `.content`.scrollTop=0.
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html` **FFP_BUILD 388→389**. (Grant uses the home-screen PWA — no native PTR there, so ours now shows.)

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (45) — FIX: Social-media-shares never logged on DESKTOP (no native share sheet)
- **Diagnosed from data:** `social_shares` had 0 rows for Grant; `member_tier_progress` social_shares=0. The RPC + `p_member` helper were already correct (verified). Root cause: on **desktop** there's no `navigator.share`, so the Share buttons fall back to **download** (activity card) / **copy-link** (passport) — and those fallback branches never called `ffpLogSocialShare`. Only the mobile native-share path logged.
- **Fix:** `ffpDoShareCard` desktop-download branch now calls `ffpLogSocialShare('activity','download')`; `sharePassportCard` desktop copy-link fallback calls `ffpLogSocialShare('passport','link')`. (Backend dedup = 1 credit per kind per calendar day, so safe.) `ffp-member-dashboard.html` **FFP_BUILD 387→388**.
- After deploy, on desktop: tap Share on an activity card (downloads + records) or tap the passport (copies link + records) → Earnings ▸ Your Progression ▸ Social media shares ticks to 1 (max 1 per type/day).

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (44) — Cancellation window + credit-return for sessions & pro (was inconsistent; money-critical)
- **Found (verified in RPCs):** `book_session` deducts a provider-plan credit at BOOKING (good, no attendance gap like pro). Classes are pay-per-booking (no plan credit, by design). `cancel_booking` enforced a refund window only for experiences/events/classes (`refund_tiers`/`free_cancellation_hours`); **provider_session + professional_session fell to a legacy 14-day fallback**, and a CREDIT booking cancelled in-window **never returned the credit**.
- **Fix (Grant: each pro/partner sets own, default 24h; auto-return credit in-window, manual override kept):**
  - Cols: `session_templates.free_cancellation_hours` + `pro_services.free_cancellation_hours` (default **24**); `bookings.credit_source_kind` ('provider_plan'|'pro_package') + `credit_source_id` (links a credit booking to the plan/package it drew from).
  - `book_session` / `pro_book_slot` now STAMP `credit_source_*` on credit bookings.
  - `cancel_booking` now reads the window for provider_session (via `session_templates`) + professional_session (via `pro_slots→pro_services`), and **auto-returns the credit** when a credit booking is cancelled inside the free window (`provider_member_plans`/`pro_client_packages` +qty; pro logs a `cancel_return` row in `pro_package_uses`). Money refunds unchanged; credit bookings set `refunded_aed=0`.
- Migrations LIVE: `cancellation_window_and_credit_source_columns`, `stamp_credit_source_on_credit_bookings`, `cancel_booking_session_pro_window_and_credit_return`. Verified: cols present, all 3 fns carry the new logic.
- **Authority UI DONE:** "Free cancellation (hrs)" field added to the partner session editor (`ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js`, `tpl-cancel-hours` → payload `free_cancellation_hours`) and the pro services editor (`ffp-professional-services-loader.js`, `sv-free_cancellation_hours`). RPCs `provider_save_session_template`/`provider_list_session_templates` + `pro_save_service`/`pro_list_services` now persist + return the column (migration `save_list_rpcs_carry_free_cancellation_hours`). Cache-busts: provider `_provLoaderSrc scheduling ?v=20→21`; pro `PRO_BUILD 43→44`. (cancel_booking uses auth.uid() — booking-site session — unchanged.)
- DEPLOY: `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v21); `ffp-professional-services-loader.js` + `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (Build 44).

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (43) — 🔴→✅ PRO PACKAGE CREDITS: decrement on attendance + usage history (was BLOCKING; money-critical)
- **Root cause:** only `pro_book_slot` decremented a package credit; check-in (`pro_checkin_service`/`pro_checkin_member`) and standing-slot attendance recorded `activity_logs` but NEVER consumed a credit → coach balances stuck (e.g. Grant's "10 PT Session" still 10 after attending).
- **Single source (zero patching):** new SECURITY DEFINER `pro_consume_package_credit(p_member,p_professional,p_service,p_source,p_used_at,p_dedup)` — finds active package (service-match or agnostic), decrements, writes a `pro_package_uses` row; ±3h dedup (when p_dedup) prevents book-then-checkin / double-checkin double-charge. Execute revoked from anon/authenticated (internal only).
- **Migrations (LIVE):** `pro_package_uses_table_and_consume_helper`, `pro_credit_single_source_consume` (`pro_book_slot` REFACTORED to call the consume fn — no inline decrement), `pro_checkin_consume_credit_on_attendance` (both check-in RPCs `perform` the consume fn).
- **Ask 2 (LIVE):** table `pro_package_uses` + `member_package_uses(p_member,p_package)` → `{uses:[{used_at,service_name,source}]}` (granted anon+authenticated). For booking-site "tap a package → dated sessions". Added to FFP-BOOKINGS.md.
- **Verified non-destructively** on Grant's live package via a DO block that consumed then RAISEd (rolled back): consume=true, credits 10→9, member_package_uses returned the use; balance left untouched at 10.
- **Backfill DONE** (Grant said "all packages"): `pro_reconcile_package_credits()` (idempotent, conservative — never <0, excludes credit-booked sessions ±3h, dedups member+pro) ran → only **Grant's "10 PT Session" 10→9** (1 attended), no other package affected. Doc `FFP-PRO-PACKAGE-USAGE-ASK-FOR-PASSPORT.md` updated 🔴→✅.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (42) — Member dashboard batch: activity→share, connect-notif routing, notif show-once + Clear all, notif drawer
- **#1 Log Activity → share card:** `saveLog` (both new `log_activity` and edit `update_activity` paths) now calls `_ffpSaveThenShare(id, act, city, entry, photo)` → sets `window._ffpActCard` + opens `_ffpOpenShareSheet` so the member lands on the shareable activity card right after saving.
- **#2 "X added your passport" notification routing:** `handle_connection` RPC (migration `handle_connection_notif_link_with_requester`, LIVE) now writes link `ffp-member-dashboard.html?connect=<requester_id>#panel-meet` (was `#connections`, which `ffpHandleNotifClick` ignored → tap did nothing). `ffpHandleNotifClick` now handles `?connect=<id>` → open Connections panel (`panel-meet`) + `MeetMove.openMemberDetail(id)` (their passport card); legacy `#connections` → open the panel.
- **#3 Notifications show-once + Clear all (BOTH):** review prompts filtered out of the list once seen (`ffp_seen_reviews`, already set on bell-open); `clearNotifs()` now PERSISTS — sets `ffp_notifs_cleared_at` (loadNotifications hides notifs ≤ that), dismisses current reviews, POSTs `/api/notifications/seen`. (Clear is per-device/localStorage — offer server-side `notifs_cleared_at` if cross-device needed.)
- **#4 Notifications drawer:** `#notif-menu` only (NOT the shared `.menu`) restyled as a right-side drawer — `50vw` (min 320 / max 480), full height (`100dvh`), slide-in, over a `#notif-scrim` at `rgba(0,0,0,.6)`. A MutationObserver mirrors the menu's `.show` onto the scrim (covers every open/close path).
- **#5 Pull-to-refresh (per active panel):** `_ffpInitPullToRefresh()` — at the top of the ACTIVE `.panel-view`, a downward pull reloads ONLY that panel via its existing reload fn (map: passport→loadJourneyLogs/ffpReloadPassport, meet→ffpReloadMeetMove+ConnFeed, meetups, quests→Quests.init, challenges, earnings, experiences, fitness-stats, calorie-tracker, profile) + `loadNotifications`. Floating spinner indicator; `overscroll-behavior-y:contain` suppresses the browser's native pull-reload; skips when a modal/drawer/map is the touch target. No full page reload.
- File: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (**FFP_BUILD 383→387**). All frontend except the #2 DB migration (live).

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (41) — BUGFIX: Social-media-shares never recorded — `log_social_share` relied on auth.uid() (always NULL)
- **Root cause (mine, NOT a deploy issue):** `window.supabase` is the ANON client (`createClient(..., ANON_KEY, {auth:{persistSession:false}})` in `ffp-api-integration.js`); auth is a custom localStorage layer (`FFPAuth`). So `auth.uid()` is ALWAYS NULL for RPC calls — my `log_social_share` used `auth.uid()`, so it silently inserted nothing (verified: `social_shares` had 0 rows across ALL members). Every other writing RPC here passes an explicit member id; I hadn't.
- **Fix (migration `log_social_share_explicit_member`, LIVE):** dropped `log_social_share(text,text)`; recreated as **`log_social_share(p_member uuid, p_kind text, p_platform text)`** (SECURITY DEFINER, same per-kind-per-day dedup), granted to anon+authenticated. Verified end-to-end: calling it with a real member id inserted a row (self-test inserted=1, then deleted).
- **Frontend (`ffp-member-dashboard.html`, FFP_BUILD 382→**383**):** `ffpLogSocialShare` now passes `p_member: m.id` (from `FFPAuth.getMember()`).
- **Lesson reinforced:** in this app NEVER rely on `auth.uid()` — always pass the member id explicitly (the anon client carries no session).

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (40) — Meet-up GUEST-CANCEL now notifies + emails the HOST (was silent) + MeetMove already-extracted note
- **Gap found & fixed:** when a guest cancelled their spot / withdrew a request, the host got **nothing** (`leave_meetup` only set the attendee row to 'cancelled'; the loader sent no email). Now:
  - **DB (LIVE, migration `leave_meetup_notify_host`):** `leave_meetup` inserts a host `notifications` row — "Someone left your meet-up" / "Join request withdrawn" (icon `person_remove`), transactional so it always fires. Verified in pg_get_functiondef.
  - **Backend (`index.js` v99→**v100**, NEEDS VERCEL DEPLOY):** `/api/meetups/notify` now handles `{kind:'leave', meetup_id, member_id, pending}` → emails the host via new `sendMeetupLeaveEmail`. Email is best-effort; in-app notice is the RPC's job (no double-notify).
  - **Frontend (`ffp-meet-move-loader.js`, NEEDS NETLIFY DEPLOY):** after a successful `leave_meetup`, POSTs `{kind:'leave',…,pending:wasPending}` (mirrors the cancel/request POSTs). Cache-bust: dashboard **FFP_BUILD 381→382**.
- **MeetMove "extraction" — already done:** the `MeetMove` object already lives in `assets/ffp-connections-core.js` (`window.MeetMove`). The dashboard only holds a ~150-line `Object.assign(MeetMove,…)` augment tangled inside a shared IIFE (ends line 12545) — left as-is (low value, surgery risk). No re-extraction performed.
- Note: bash `node --check` on `index.js` and the loader threw FALSE truncation errors (mount cuts big files mid-line, RULE 3) — verified edited blocks in isolation + via Read instead.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (39) — `Earnings` object EXTRACTED to its own core file (de-fragile cleanup)
- **`assets/ffp-earnings-core.js` (NEW, `?v=1`)** — the `Earnings` object (was inline in `ffp-member-dashboard.html` lines 9533–9993) + its two modal-backdrop helpers moved out **verbatim** (byte-for-byte, no retyping); `const Earnings` → **`window.Earnings`**. Loaded in `<head>` right after `ffp-quests-core.js` and AFTER `ffp-constants.js` (the object reads `window.FFP_CONST` at definition). Mirrors the proven Quests-core extraction pattern.
- Dashboard HTML now has only a pointer comment where the object was; boot still calls `Earnings.init()`; all ~20 inline `onclick="Earnings.x()"` handlers + the lazy `ffp-earnings-loader.js` resolve via the global.
- Verified this turn: 0 `const Earnings` left in HTML; 1 `window.Earnings =` in core; `node --check` core = OK; seam clean (EARNINGS header → pointer → SHARED MODAL/TOAST HELPERS). Removed region is self-balanced JS, so the remaining HTML stays balanced.
- **⚠️ DEPLOY BOTH TOGETHER:** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (**FFP_BUILD 379→380**) AND new `assets/ffp-earnings-core.js`. Shipping the HTML without the new file = `Earnings` undefined = broken Earnings panel. (A local `ffp-member-dashboard.html.bak_earnings_extract` safety copy exists — do NOT commit it.)

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (38) — Earnings "Your Progression": Tasks + Social shares wired; build-discipline rule added
- **RULE 0.6 added to `CLAUDE.md`** (Grant logged a VIOLATION on build-number guessing): never state/bump a build from memory — READ the constant in the file THIS TURN, cite the line; the device "Build N" stamp is the ONLY live truth (`web_fetch`/raw github are cached, they lie); verify with a tool before claiming any number/state/"works". APPLY EVERY MESSAGE.
- **"Your Progression" categories** (`ffp-member-dashboard.html`, `Earnings.categories`): `quests_completed` row relabelled **"Tasks completed"** (unit 'tasks'), targets Supporter **1→4**, Ambassador **2→10**; `challenges_completed` row REPLACED by **`social_shares`** "Social media shares" (unit 'shares', icon 'share'), targets Supporter **10**, Ambassador **30**. Definitions live in the dashboard HTML `Earnings` object; the earnings loader only writes RPC counts onto `Earnings.categories` (verified — no progression labels hardcoded in the loader).
- **Social-share tracking WIRED end-to-end** (migration `social_shares_tracking_and_tier_metric`, LIVE + verified): new `social_shares` table (member_id, kind, platform, created_at; RLS select-own); `log_social_share(p_kind,p_platform)` SECURITY DEFINER, dedups to 1 credit per kind per calendar day; BOTH `member_tier_progress()` overloads now return `social_shares` = count in the 30-day window. Frontend: central `window.ffpLogSocialShare(kind,platform)` (non-blocking, refreshes `Earnings.loadTierStats`) called ONLY on genuine social shares — `sharePassportCard` (2 paths, kind 'passport') + activity-card `navigator.share` (kind 'activity'); downloads NOT logged. Verified: table=1, log_fn=1, both tier fns contain social_shares.
- Files: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (**FFP_BUILD 377→379**), `CLAUDE.md` (RULE 0.6).
- **Caveat:** "Tasks completed" count currently sources from `quest_progress` (completed quests). If "tasks" becomes a distinct unit, the RPC needs its own count.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (37) — GAP #3b cascade + Confirm-before-action — DB LIVE + provider/pro dashboards NEED DEPLOY
- **#3b cascade (migration `provider_cancel_session_cascade_bookings`, LIVE + verified):** `provider_cancel_session` now also `update bookings set status='cancelled', cancelled_at=now() where item_type='provider_session' and item_id=p_id and status<>'cancelled'` → the existing `trg_notify_booking_change` auto-notifies each affected member. Refund/credit return stays a SEPARATE partner-driven control (per Grant's decision) — NOT automatic.
- **NEW REQ — Confirm before assign/cancel/change/amend** (Grant: "on all options"). Added blocking `confirm()` (doesn't disrupt the open modal) to: provider scheduling `cancelOccurrence` (cancel session — warns members will be cancelled+notified, credits not auto-returned), `occRemove` (remove member), `occDoAdd` (add member, names the pay method); pro scheduling `cancelOcc` (block), `doReschedule`. Form-based actions (reschedule form Apply, add-people Save) already deliberate.
- Files: `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` (v18→**v19**), `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` (**PRO_BUILD 40→41**), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`, `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`.
- **Partner refund/credit-return control — DONE (migration `partner_refund_credit_return_controls`, LIVE):** after a provider session cancel, an "Return credits / refunds" modal lists each affected member with their pay method + a discretionary action: **Return credit** (`provider_return_credit` → adds the seat back to the member's plan, idempotent via `[credit returned]` notes marker, notifies) or **Refund** (`provider_refund_booking` → sets `refunded_aed`=total + `payment_status='refunded'` + notifies → frontend calls backend `/api/pay/refund` to move the Stripe money on the connected account). `provider_session_refund_list` feeds the modal. Comp/unpaid = nothing to return. Each action behind a `confirm()`. scheduling loader v19→**v20**.
## LATEST 2026-06-20 (38) — Pro-occurrence cancel cascade + Confirm sweep — DB LIVE + pro dashboard NEEDS DEPLOY
- **Pro cascade (migration `pro_cancel_occurrence_cascade_bookings`, LIVE + verified):** `pro_cancel_occurrence` now cascade-cancels member bookings for that slot+date (`item_type='professional_session'`, `item_id=slot`, `(scheduled_at at time zone <pro tz>)::date = occ_date` — mirrors `pro_book_slot`) → `trg_notify_booking_change` auto-notifies. Provider sessions cascade was done in (37).
- **Confirm sweep extended (PRO_BUILD 41→42):** added `confirm()` to pro `pauseSlot` (pause stops bookings) + `saveSlotPeople` (change attendees). Already covered earlier: pro `cancelOcc`/`doReschedule`, provider `cancelOccurrence`/`occRemove`/`occDoAdd`; `confirmEndSlot` + the `confirmDelete*` family already use confirm modals; resume/unblock left as-is (restorative/safe).
- File: `ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` (+PRO_BUILD 42 in `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`).
- **PRO refund/credit-return control — DONE (migration `pro_refund_credit_return_controls`, LIVE + verified):** full parity with provider. After a pro blocks/cancels an occurrence, an "Return credits / refunds" modal lists affected members with **Return credit** (`pro_return_credit` → bridges member→pro_client by email → adds credit back to `pro_client_packages`, idempotent, notifies) or **Refund** (`pro_refund_booking` → sets refunded_aed + notifies → frontend `/api/pay/refund`, which resolves the PRO's connected account via slot→professional). `pro_occurrence_refund_list` feeds it (slot+date, pro tz). Each behind `confirm()`. PRO_BUILD 42→43.
- **BOOKING LOOP COMPLETE:** #1–#6 done; #3b done both provider + pro (cascade → notify → discretionary credit/refund); Confirm-before-action across booking management. Only #7 (Stripe test infra) remains — Grant's side.

## (prev remaining noted) 

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (36) — Booking loop GAP #2: intake display — class/session surfaces DONE — provider dashboard + 2 loaders NEED DEPLOY
- **Reusable intake renderer** for `booking_details = { guests:[{first_name,last_name,gender,age,answers:{key:val}}], booking_answers:{key:val} }` (shape confirmed via `ffp_validate_booking_details`): renders "Guest N · Name (gender, age) — Custom Q: val" + booking-level answers. Local copy in each loader (robust to lazy-load order); also exposed `window._ffpBookingIntake`.
- **Provider SESSION roster (scheduling loader v17→v18):** extended `provider_session_roster` RPC to return `details = b.booking_details` (migration `provider_session_roster_add_details`, LIVE); `occRosterRow` now shows each booker's intake under their pay/membership chips.
- **Provider TOURS/classes (classes loader v19→v20):** new "Bookings & guest details" button on each class card → modal grouping bookings by session date with each booker + intake (uses `provider_class_bookings`, which already returned `details`).
- **#2 RESOLVED for all flows that collect intake.** Verified: per-guest intake (`booking_details`) is ONLY collected by `create_booking` (experiences/trips/classes) + `book_session` (provider sessions) — both now displayed (above). **`pro_book_slot` does NOT store booking_details** (verified, `stores_details=0`) and **`book_event_order` doesn't take p_details** — so PRO sessions and EVENTS never collect guest intake; nothing to display there (not a gap). The pro side already shows each booked client via `clientProfile` (their saved details); events show ticket tiers. To get intake on pro/events would require ADDING collection (`pro_book_slot`/`book_event_order` accept `p_details` + the site collects it) — a product decision, not a display task.
- Files: `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` (v18), `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` (v20), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (loader versions). node --check unreliable on these (mount truncation, RULE 3) — edited blocks verified balanced via Read.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (35) — Booking loop GAP #5: admin full pro-approval preview — admin dashboard NEEDS DEPLOY
- **Admin pro verification card → "View full profile" button** opens an in-admin modal that renders EXACTLY what publishes on Find Fit People (the public site only shows approved pros, so the old "Preview public page" link was dead for pending — removed it). Mirrors the public profile: cover + profile photo, name, headline, category + type chips, location, years experience, languages, certifications, bio, plus live **Services** (`pro_list_services`) and **Intro videos** (`pro_videos_list`) with graceful fallback, and an admin-only contact line. Built from the full `professionals` row (`professional_verification_list` returns `to_jsonb(pr)`). `_rows` cached; self-contained overlay (no dashboard modal dep). `node --check` OK.
- Files: `ffp-admin-professionals-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (lazy cache-bust **v=61→62**).
- **Still next:** #2 partner/pro intake DISPLAY across 3 surfaces (event guest list — needs paid-booking cross-ref since roster reads `rsvps`; class/session via `provider_class_bookings`; pro booked-client view), and #3b cascade.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (34) — Booking loop GAP #4 done + GAP #2 mostly already live — DB LIVE (no deploy)
- **GAP #4 DONE:** `member_my_bookings` now returns `checked_in_at` + `checkin_verified` via a lateral join to `booking_checkins` (latest check-in for that booking+member). No new RLS surface (booking_checkins stays SECURITY-DEFINER-only). My Coaching can now show real "session used" time instead of the scheduled proxy.
- **GAP #2 — server side ALREADY LIVE (verified, no change):** (a) member read-back: `member_my_bookings` already returns `'details' = b.booking_details`. (b) required-question enforcement: BOTH `create_booking` and `book_session` already call `ffp_validate_booking_details(questions, details, qty)`. REMAINING = frontend only: surface `booking_details` on the partner & pro booking views (who's coming + sizes) — reads via `provider_class_bookings` / `member_bookings_at_venue` + dashboard render.
- **Booking-loop scoreboard:** #1 ✅ (backend v99, deploy) · #2 server ✅ / UI todo · #3 ✅ (trigger + plan/pkg) / #3b cascade todo · #4 ✅ · #5 todo (admin pro preview, frontend) · #6 ✅ verified · #7 infra (Grant: Stripe test keys + connected test acct + Connect webhook).

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (33) — Booking loop GAP #3: booking-change → member notification — DB LIVE (no deploy)
- **Single-source actor-aware trigger `trg_notify_booking_change` on `bookings`** (`ffp_notify_booking_change`, SECURITY DEFINER): on status→'cancelled' or scheduled_at change (genuine move), inserts a `notifications` row for `member_id`. Skips the member's OWN action — `bookings.member_id = auth.uid()`, so it only fires when `auth.uid() <> member_id` (partner/pro/admin). Confirmed via reschedule_class_booking that bookings.member_id IS the auth uid.
- **provider_cancel_member_plan** → notifies `member_id` (passport member) "Membership cancelled".
- **pro_cancel_client_package** → bridges `client_id → pro_clients.email = members.email` → notifies the passport member "Package cancelled" (skips if the pro's client isn't a passport member).
- notifications table = (id, audience, member_id, title, body, icon, link, created_at); member UI reads by member_id.
- **GAP FOUND (tracked as #3b):** `provider_cancel_session` / `pro_cancel_occurrence` / `provider_cancel_appointment` / reschedule-occurrence operate on `provider_sessions`/`pro_slot_exceptions`/`provider_appointments` — they DON'T update the member's `bookings` row, so cancelling a whole session neither cancels the member's booking nor notifies. Needs a behavioural decision (cascade-cancel member bookings + credit policy) before wiring — then the trigger auto-notifies.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (32) — Cross-ecosystem booking loop: GAP #1 checkout endpoint (backend v99) + GAP #6 refund verified — backend NEEDS DEPLOY
Working through the Passport booking↔management loop doc (priority #1→#3→#2→#4→#5→#6/#7).
- **GAP #1 DONE — `POST /api/pay/booking-checkout {booking_id}` → `{url}` (backend v98→v99):** verified via DB that BOTH `create_booking` (Experiences/Trips) and `book_event_order` (paid Events) insert into the unified `bookings` table with `provider_id` + `total_aed`. So one generic endpoint = session-checkout generalised: read `booking.provider_id` → `providers.stripe_account_id` (must be `payments_status='connected'`) → `connectedCheckout` (Connect Standard, partner currency via `toMinorUnits`, zero fee) → `success_url` = `/api/pay/confirm?kind=booking&...`. Added `kind==='booking'` to `finalisePaidCheckout` (→ `mark_booking_paid` + "Payment confirmed" notify, idempotent) AND to the webhook backup array. `node --check` passes. The booking site already calls this endpoint (was falling back to "held").
- **GAP #6 VERIFIED (no change needed):** `/api/pay/refund {booking_id}` is live in backend v96 + complete — requires `status='cancelled'` (call `cancel_booking` first), refunds `refunded_aed` on the same connected account (facility via provider_id / pro via pro_slots→professional), idempotent; credit/unpaid just cancel. booking-checkout payments are refundable through it (intent stored via mark_booking_paid).
- **GAP #7 (infra, Grant):** end-to-end charge→confirm→refund test still blocked on Stripe TEST keys + ≥1 connected test account (0/4 facilities connected) + `checkout.session.completed` (incl. Connect) webhook.
- **Still OPEN (tracked):** #3 booking-change → member notification (next), #2 surface `p_details` to partners/pros + member read-back, #4 member-readable check-in time, #5 admin pro-approval preview.
- File: `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/ffp-passport-backend-main/index.js` (v99). Grant deploys backend to Vercel.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (31) — Provider Overview rating stars FIX — dashboard NEEDS DEPLOY
- `prStars()` renders Material Symbols `star` but base `.ms` sets `FILL 0` → "on" stars rendered as OUTLINES (looked empty, esp. after de-yellow recoloured them slate). Fixed `.pr-star.on` → `font-variation-settings:'FILL' 1` (now actually FILLED) + `color:#FFB400` (rating gold — the one place yellow is the world-class standard; de-yellowing stays everywhere else); empty stars → `var(--ffp-border-mid)` faint. File: `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`.

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (30) — Log Activity location → guarantee Country+City auto-fill (FFP_BUILD=377) — member dashboard NEEDS DEPLOY
- **Already built (verified, not rebuilt):** Log Activity's `FFPLocPick` pin / "Use my current location" reverse-geocodes the spot (`reverseCenter` sets `cur.city`/`cur.country`) and `logSetLocation()` auto-fills the Country + City selects (adds the option if missing). So on the current build it should already populate.
- **Gap found + fixed:** the reverse-geocode is debounced (450ms) + async, so tapping "Use this location" before it finishes — or a Nominatim hiccup — could hand back empty city/country. Hardened **`FFPLocPick.use()`** to be `async` and, when city/country are still empty, deterministically resolve them via the keyless **BigDataCloud** reverse-geocode (already used elsewhere in the app, line ~11147) before invoking the callback. Now Country+City fill reliably from pin/GPS. FFP_BUILD 376→377.
- File: `ffp-member-dashboard.html`. (Big file; validated the changed block via Read/Edit — bash node --check unreliable on mount truncation per RULE 3.)

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (29) — Partner MEMBERS: platform-standard modal + pull-from-passport + square photo — DB LIVE; dashboard + members loader NEED DEPLOY
- **DB (migration `provider_members_passport_fields`, LIVE):** added `given_names`, `surname`, `photo_url` to `provider_members`; `provider_save_member` stores them (+ keeps combined `full_name`); new **`provider_passport_by_email(p_provider uuid, p_email text)`** — mirrors `pro_passport_by_email`, checks `providers`, returns given/surname/full_name/gender/dob/nationality/email/combined-phone/photo_url. Verified live (returns Grant's passport row + avatar).
- **Members modal rebuilt (members loader v3→v4):** "Pull from FFP Passport" button at top (`pullMemberFromPassport()` prefills given/surname/phone/photo by email); **Given names + Surname** (→ combined `full_name` on save); **Phone = country-code select + number** (`_memPhoneFieldHtml`/`_memSplitPhone`/`_memGetPhone`, `FFP_TAX.phoneCodes`); **City = taxonomy select** flattened from `FFP_TAX.cities` (`_memCities`); **Add photo** via shared `FFPUpload` (quest-images bucket, 1:1 → `photo_url`, `pickMemberPhoto()`). Native selects (provider `openModalShell` doesn't FFPSelect-enhance).
- **Member strap:** avatar now shows the square **photo** (`m.photo_url`, else initials square); strap bg → card grey `rgba(15,37,49,.05)`; status pills recoloured for light-theme contrast.
- **Round-2 corrections to EXACT platform standard (members loader v4→v5; migration `provider_members_add_country` LIVE — added `country` col + save):**
  - **Phone** → standard `.phone-input` + `select.phone-cc` (flag+code from `FFP_TAX.phoneCodes`) + `.input.phone-num` (was a custom native select). Added a **flag webfont** (`@font-face FFPFlags`, Twemoji Country Flags woff2 from jsdelivr, `unicode-range U+1F1E6-1F1FF`) applied to `.phone-cc/.ffp-picker-*/.ffp-sel-*` so flag emoji actually render on Windows (which otherwise shows "AE").
  - **Country + City** → shared searchable **`FFPPicker.openCountry`/`openCity`** buttons (`.ffp-picker-btn`, `_memPickCountry`/`_memPickCity`; city resets on country change) — replaces the flat native city select. New `country` column stored alongside `city`.
  - **Member strap photo** → now fills the strap **edge-to-edge, full height** (`align-items:stretch`, 64px photo column, no padding gap) instead of a small floating square.
- Files: `ffp-provider-members-loader.js`, `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (members ?v=5; + flag font). Real file intact via Read (762 lines; bash node --check unreliable on mount truncation per RULE 3).

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (28) — Partner portal post-deploy fixes (analytics empty state, calendar, card body) — NEEDS DEPLOY
Live now (Grant deployed Build with the light rebrand). Fixes:
- **Listing-card body separation:** `.listing-card` background `transparent → rgba(15,37,49,.05)` (~5% grey) so each card lifts off the white page (per Grant). Still no border, photo hero on top.
- **Analytics empty state:** scaffold sections (funnel/trend/age/gender/tier/area/sport/deals/events/peak/retention) wrapped in `#analytics-sections`; `renderAnalytics()` now hides that wrapper (engagement tracking still not wired → no data), so the panel shows ONLY the honest "No analytics yet" card instead of a stack of bare headers. NOT broken — just awaiting engagement data (future task to wire views/RSVPs/check-ins).
- **Appointments calendar (loader v8→v9):** day-view coach header cells now have `--ffp-bg-3` light-grey bg + 2px `--ffp-border-mid` divider; coach column body dividers 1px→2px (thicker separation per Grant); availability shading strengthened from faint `rgba(46,204,113,.09)` → `rgba(31,157,87,.16)` + 3px solid `#1f9d57` left bar (clearly visible). NOTE: availability is weekday-specific — Grant's is "Every Mon", so it shows on Mondays (week view Mon 15 ✓); the Saturday day-view was empty because there's no Monday availability that day, not a bug.
- **Today button:** `apToday()` resets the calendar anchor to facility-today and re-renders the current view (day/week/month) — working as intended (Grant's question was cut off; awaiting clarification).
- **Quests nav ENABLED:** removed `soon/locked` from the NAV quests item — now clickable (panel `#panel-quests` + `FFPQuestCheckins.reload()` already wired; quests-loader v5, quest-create v2).
- **Card update coverage (answer to "are events/trips/experiences cards updated?"):** YES — Events, Trips (experiences), Challenges & Deals cards are ALL built in the dashboard JS (`renderEvents/renderExperiences/renderChallenges/renderDeals`, lines ~4072/4234/4519/4832) using the shared `.listing-card`; the Experiences panel's classes-loader uses the same class. So the boxless + 5% grey-body change covers every listing panel. (Loaders only build the create/edit modals, not the cards.)
- **Box backgrounds → card grey (per Grant):** white container boxes now use the same `rgba(15,37,49,.05)` as the listing cards — `.card` and `.checkin-card` (dashboard) + `.vq-card` (venue-QR loader, bumped **v4→v5**). Borders kept (thin) for definition; inputs stay white for contrast. Covers Check-ins (QR box + session box) and any `.card` box elsewhere.
- Files: `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`, `ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js`, `ffp-provider-venue-qr-loader.js`. (Real file verified intact via Read; bash `node --check` false-failed on mount truncation per RULE 3.)

## LATEST 2026-06-20 (27) — Partner (provider) portal REBRAND: light theme + primary blue #1980AD — NEEDS DEPLOY
- **Approved concept first (mockup):** light, world-class, **boxless** — grey sidebar (`--ffp-bg #e7e8ea`), WHITE content (`--ffp-bg-2 #ffffff`), KPIs as an open stat ribbon split by hairline rules (no cards), active nav = white lozenge with blue text. Blue is **accent-only** (logo, active nav, primary buttons/links, one highlight number). Grey canvas, NOT blue-grey.
- **`ffp-provider-dashboard.html` :root remapped** dark→light: `--ffp-blue #2ba8e0→#1980AD` (blue-dark #13657f), bg/text/border tokens to light + neutral grey borders (`rgba(15,37,49,.08/.14/.24)`), shadows lightened. Structural fixes: `.sidebar` bg → `--ffp-bg` (grey); `.main` + `.topbar` + `.save-bar` + `.uploader-preview-btn` dark→white; `.modal-foot`/`.itin-day` → light grey; `.lc-cat-pill` kept as dark photo-scrim w/ white text; `.ni.active` → white lozenge + blue text; `.ffp-picker` shared component → light; `color-scheme:dark→light` (native date/time pickers); section titles + `.sb-sub` yellow→blue (yellow-on-white was unreadable).
- **All provider loaders rebranded** (single sed pass over `ffp-provider-*.js`): `#0f1e2e/#0a1825→#fff`, `#1a2f44→#d8dde2`, `#e8eef4→#0e2531`, `#0c1d2b→#fff`, option text `#f5f7fa→#0e2531`, `#2ba8e0→#1980AD`, `rgba(43,168,224,*)→rgba(25,128,173,*)`, `#8a99a8→#566069`. `var(--ffp-*,#dark)` fallbacks left as-is (resolve correctly via root). Provider billing `_metric` dark box → light grey tile + hairline border (like the pro fix). All 17 loaders pass `node --check`.
- **Cache-busts bumped** for every changed+referenced loader: map → checkins v4, scheduling v17, members v3, billing v3, staff v4, classes v19, appointments v8; tags → profile v17, events v17, experiences v15, quests v5, quest-create v2, venue-qr v4, challenges +?v=2, notifications +?v=2. (deals-loader edited but not referenced by this dashboard — no bump.)
- **Verify on device:** sidebar grey + white content; active nav = white lozenge; KPIs boxless; no dark cards/inputs anywhere; dropdowns/date pickers light; Payments tiles readable.
- **Refinement round 2 (same files):**
  - **Boxless (Option B, approved):** shared single-source classes de-boxed — `.kpi` now a divided stat ribbon (gap:0 + `kpi+kpi` left hairline, no border/bg), `.section-card` opened (transparent, no border), `.listing-card` border removed (photo hero + soft hover shadow carries it). Propagates to every panel.
  - **Yellow removed → grey/black variety:** `--ffp-yellow #FFCC00→#2b3942` (slate), `--ffp-yellow-dk→#1b252c`; added **`--ffp-warn #c9820f`**. Primary buttons (`.btn-pri`) yellow→**blue**; tab underline/active-count→slate/dark; nav `.ni-badge`→grey; bell dot, qa-icon, itin-day-num, period-chip.active, peak-cell.hot, profile extras btn→**blue**; rank-num→dark; `.label .req`→**red**; pr-star + all `rgba(255,204,0,*)` tints + bare `#FFCC00` → slate/grey (sed across dashboard + loaders). Loader `var(--ffp-yellow)` inherits the new slate automatically.
  - **Warnings solid + standout:** `.lc-status-pill.pending`→solid `--ffp-warn` white text; `.draft`→solid grey white text; dirty/unsaved + `sb-foot-tag.pending`→`--ffp-warn`; loader status/empty notes (`color:#FFCC00`)→`--ffp-warn`.
  - **Dropdowns fixed (light-blue bg + light font):** added Pro-style **FFPSelect light overrides** (`.ffp-sel-*` `!important`: white bg, `--ffp-text`, blue active) in the dashboard `<style>` — beats the shared dark `#ffp-select-css`. (Native `select`/options already light via color-scheme + earlier loader sed.)
  - **Challenges nav:** disabled (greyed, "Soon", non-clickable) and **moved directly above Deals**; badge logic now shows "Soon" for any `soon||locked` item. ALL provider loaders still pass `node --check`; zero `#FFCC00` left.

## LATEST 2026-06-19 (21) — Activity page REDESIGN (immersive, box-free) + share card PREVIEW with formats — member dashboard NEEDS DEPLOY (FFP_BUILD=368)
- **Activity page fully redesigned (`ffpRenderActivityCard`) — approved concept, no boxes:** immersive hero (full-bleed photo or rich gradient + big watermark glyph + scrim into the page), headline METRIC large (distance, else duration) with eyebrow (activity·date) + subline (time range·location); an EDITORIAL stat ribbon (hairline dividers, no tiles) carrying Duration/Pace/kcal/Avg HR; full-bleed rounded MAP strip with overlay; quote-style note (left accent bar); gradient "Share card" + connections-share + edit. Shared activities show the owner row with the high-five icon.
- **Share card = PREVIEW first + format picker (per Grant):** tapping "Share card" opens `_ffpOpenShareSheet` → shows the actual card scaled, with tabs **Square 1:1 / Portrait 4:5 / Story 9:16 (default 9:16)**, an optional "Use my photo as background" toggle (only if the activity has a photo), and Download + Share. `_ffpBuildShareCard(a,ratio,usePhoto)` builds at the chosen ratio; `html2canvas` (scale 2) → File; pre-rendered on each change so Share fires within the iOS user-activation; `ffpDoShareCard` shares the image (text+link fallback), `ffpDownloadActivityCard` saves PNG. FFP_BUILD 367→368.
- **Card tweaks (FFP_BUILD=371):** top wordmark text REPLACED with the white FFP logo, **centered at top**, sized 0.32×card width (20% smaller, so it supports not dominates). Logo lives in **Supabase storage**, not GitHub: `site-images` bucket → `https://kxzyuofecmtymablnmak.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/site-images/ffp-logo-white.png` (Grant uploads `assets/ffp-logo-white.png` to that bucket; html2canvas captures it via useCORS like the activity-photo bg). Default share format **Square 1:1**.
## LATEST 2026-06-20 (26) — Pro rebrand fixes + new app icon — NEEDS DEPLOY (PRO_BUILD=39)
- **Payments dark boxes:** `_metric()` in billing loader hardcoded `background:#0c1d2b` (dark) → dark text on dark. Fixed → `var(--ffp-bg-card)` + border (white card like Overview).
- **Dropdowns (shared FFPSelect, was blue tint + light text):** added Pro-SCOPED overrides in the dashboard `<style>` (`!important`, beats the injected `ffp-select-css`; provider portal untouched): `.ffp-sel-btn/.ffp-sel-menu/.ffp-sel-item/.ffp-sel-input` → white bg + `var(--ffp-text)` dark text, teal active.
- **Sign-in gate:** `.gate` background → `#0a3e44` (teal backdrop), white `.gate-card` unchanged.
- **New app icon:** generated `assets/icons/ffp-pro-{512,192,180,32}.png` = white FFP logo + "PROFESSIONAL" on `#0a3e44` (32 = logo only) from `ffp-logo-white.png` (these are SITE files → commit to repo). Manifest `theme_color`/`background_color` → `#0a3e44`, icon `?v=3`; dashboard `<meta theme-color>` → `#0a3e44`, favicon/apple-touch `?v=3`. PRO_BUILD 38→39.
- **Verify:** Payments boxes white/readable; dropdowns white w/ dark text; sign-in teal bg + white card; home-screen icon = teal FFP PROFESSIONAL.
- **Code box (PRO_BUILD=40):** sign-in 6-digit entry redesigned from 6 separate squares → ONE rounded rectangular box with 6 dot positions. `.code-row` = the box (single border+radius, focus-within teal ring); `.code-box` = transparent flex cells, `placeholder="•"` (dots when empty), teal-tint active cell. Keeps the existing 6-input JS (siCodeMove).
## (prev) LATEST 2026-06-20 (25) — Professional portal REBRAND: light theme + emblem teal #0a3e44 — PRO_BUILD=38
- **Theme = the shared CSS vars (single source).** `:root` flipped to LIGHT: bg #f4f7f8 / surfaces #fff / bg-3 #eef3f4 / card #fff; borders #e4ebec/#ccd9da; text #0f2327 / muted #5a6b6e / dim #869599. **Pro brand colour `--ffp-purple` → #0a3e44** (the emblem teal Grant gave). Blue/yellow kept.
- **Dark-theme assumptions fixed (dashboard + loaders):** all hardcoded `rgba(139,92,246,*)` → `rgba(10,62,68,*)`; `#c4b5fd` (light-purple tint text) → `#0a3e44`; `.ni.active` white-on-tint → teal text; inputs `color-scheme:dark`→`light`; `.toast` → teal bg + white text (was white text on light = invisible); rating `<b>` whites → `var(--ffp-text)`; primary-profession star → gold; empty stars `rgba(255,255,255,.18)`→`rgba(10,62,68,.16)`; loader white tints (`rgba(255,255,255,*)`)→teal tints, `#9fb0bf` muted→`#5a6b6e`. Files: `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` + client/scheduling/services loaders (billing was clean). PRO_BUILD 37→38.
- **Watch (likely minor tuning):** status pills using light blue (#6fc6ef) / yellow text on light tints may want darker shades — review on device.
- **Verify:** deploy; portal is white with deep-teal brand/buttons/active nav/toast.
## LATEST 2026-06-19 (24) — Add Client: "Pull from FFP Passport" by email — DB LIVE; pro dashboard + client loader NEEDS DEPLOY (PRO_BUILD=37)
- **DB (LIVE, migration `pro_passport_by_email`):** new RPC `pro_passport_by_email(p_pro, p_email)` (mirrors `pro_client_passport` but by email, before a client row exists; verifies caller is a professional). Returns has_account + given_names/surname/full_name/gender/date_of_birth/nationality/email/phone/passport_no/passport_active. Tested live (found + not-found).
- **`ffp-professional-client-loader.js`:** "Pull from FFP Passport" button at the TOP of the Add/Edit client modal + a hint line. `pullClientFromPassport()` reads `mm-email`, calls the RPC; on found → prefills Given names/Surname + `_phoneSet` phone, stashes `window._mmPulled`, shows "Pulled from <name>'s FFP Passport"; empty email → prompts; not found → message. `saveMember` now also sends gender/date_of_birth/nationality from `_mmPulled` (only if the email still matches), and `pro_save_client` already persists those columns. `window._mmPulled` reset on modal open. PRO_BUILD 36→37.
- **Verify:** Add client → type their email → tap Pull → name/phone fill + confirmation; Save → profile shows gender/DOB/nationality.
## (prev) LATEST 2026-06-19 (23) — Share card RIPPED OUT html2canvas → drawn on <canvas> (FFP_BUILD=376)
- **Root cause (confirmed by symptom):** html2canvas HANGS in the iOS PWA/webapp (Download froze at 92%, Share never opened). It's the unreliable dependency.
- **Rebuild (no patch):** removed html2canvas from the share card. `_ffpMakeCardCanvas(a,ratio,usePhoto)` draws the whole card with the Canvas 2D API (gradient/photo bg + scrim, logo via `drawImage` from a data-URL Image, activity/hero/sub/stats via `fillText`, divider via stroke). `_ffpLoadImg` loads the data-URL logo/photo into an Image (data: never taints → `toDataURL` always works). The **preview IS the canvas** (`_ffpRenderSharePreview` appends it) and caches `_ffpShareFile` immediately so Share/Download fire within the iOS tap (no stall). `_ffpCaptureShareCard` is now canvas→`toDataURL`→`_ffpDataUrlToFile`. Deleted `_ffpBuildShareCard`/`_ffpDrawPreview`/`_ffpPrerenderShareFile`(html2canvas path).
- **iOS Download:** `<a download>` is ignored by iOS → Download now uses `navigator.share({files})` ("Save Image") on iOS, anchor download elsewhere.
- **Validated** in isolation: preview caches file (no err), on-demand capture works, photo path works. Visual confirmed via canvas render.
- **(superseded) 22/375 — toBlob/single-div/error-surfacing on the html2canvas path** — folded into the canvas rebuild (error surfacing kept).
## (superseded) LATEST 2026-06-19 (22) — Share card image generation FIXES (iOS webapp) — FFP_BUILD=375
- **Context:** users are on the iOS **PWA/webapp**, not desktop. Three fact-based fixes to image generation:
  1. **Capture a single sized `<div>` directly** (`html2canvas(node)`), not an offscreen `position:absolute;inset:0` inner child — those render blank/0-size + stall (was the 92% freeze / Share not opening). `_ffpBuildShareCard` returns ONE styled div now.
  2. **`canvas.toDataURL('image/png')` → File** instead of `canvas.toBlob` — toBlob is unreliable on iOS Safari/WebKit; `_ffpDataUrlToFile` builds a File (Blob fallback if File ctor absent).
  3. **Surface the REAL error:** `_ffpShareErr` set in `_ffpCaptureShareCard`; Download/Share now toast `Image failed: <reason>` instead of silently failing — so we get the actual cause, no guessing.
- **Still possibly needed (iOS PWA):** `<a download>` doesn't save to camera roll on iOS — the iOS way to save is the share sheet ("Save Image"). If image now GENERATES but Download doesn't save, switch Download to share-to-save. Awaiting the real error/behaviour from device.
- **(superseded) 374 — single-div capture:** folded into above.
- **(superseded) 374 note kept below.** REAL FIX (FFP_BUILD=374) — Download stalled / Share didn't open: deep analysis — the Passport share works with the SAME html2canvas on the SAME page; the difference was the activity card captured `node.firstChild`, an **absolutely-positioned (`inset:0`) inner div on an offscreen (`left:-10000px`) parent** → html2canvas renders those blank/0-size and stalls `toBlob`. Fix: `_ffpBuildShareCard` now returns ONE sized `<div>` (bg/flex/padding on the element itself) and `_ffpCaptureShareCard` captures `html2canvas(node)` directly — the proven Passport pattern. (The 373 data-URL preload is kept and still correct.)
- **(prev) 373 — data-URL preload:** root cause = html2canvas hanging on the CROSS-ORIGIN storage logo (and would taint the canvas). Fix: preload remote images (the `site-images` logo, and the activity photo when "use my photo" is on) to **data URLs** once (`_ffpImgToDataUrl`/`_ffpEnsureLogo`/`_ffpEnsurePhoto`, cached), and the card builder uses those data URLs (text "FFP" fallback if a load fails). So the captured node has NO cross-origin images → html2canvas resolves instantly; added `imageTimeout:6000` as a safety. Logo still SOURCED from storage (fetched once, not committed to GitHub). Preview draws immediately (text logo) then upgrades when the asset is ready.
- **Download progress (FFP_BUILD=372):** the Download button now shows a filling progress bar + "Saving… N%" while the image renders, then "Saved ✓" + a toast when the file drops (no native % for a local export, so the bar animates during the html2canvas render and snaps to 100% on completion).
- **Share = IMAGE only (never a URL):** `ffpDoShareCard` now always exports the card via html2canvas and shares the file (`navigator.share{files}`) with a short caption (no link); if a device can't share images it DOWNLOADS instead of falling back to a URL. Uses the pre-rendered file when ready (iOS activation), else captures on tap.
- **Data limits:** HR-zone bars + GPS route line still need device sync (Garmin/Polar) — card built to slot them in later.
- **Verify:** open an own activity → immersive page; tap Share card → preview, switch formats, toggle photo, Download/Share.

## LATEST 2026-06-19 (20) — Pro Session-options revamp + block=grey-out — DB LIVE; pro dashboard NEEDS DEPLOY (PRO_BUILD=36)
- **DB (LIVE, migration `pro_week_blocked_and_unblock`):** `pro_week_schedule` now KEEPS 'cancelled' occurrences flagged `blocked:true` (greyed) instead of dropping them; new `pro_unblock_occurrence(pro,slot,date)` removes the cancelled exception. Tested live: block→blocked=true in week, unblock→gone.
- **`ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` — `openOccActions` rebuilt (now async, reads slot from cache):** (1) session **note at the top**; (2) **booked-client straps** → tap → `clientProfile(id)` (client module); (3) **Add or remove people** is now a large solid-purple `btn-pri`; (4) **Block this date** greys the session on the calendar (occCard `opacity:.5` + "Blocked" badge) and the sheet offers **Make available again** (`unblockOcc`→`pro_unblock_occurrence`). occCard passes `blocked` to `openOccActions`.
- **(5) "Edit standing slot" bug** = the earlier `pro_list_slots` `pricing_mode` error (empty cache). Fixed live; the editor now finds the slot and opens prefilled "Edit slot". PRO_BUILD 35→36.
- **Verify:** tap a session → note shows on top, booked client strap opens their profile, purple Add/remove; Block → session greys (not vanishes) → Make available again; Edit standing slot opens the existing slot prefilled.

## LATEST 2026-06-19 (19) — Connections "From your people" feed: every row taps through to its target — DB LIVE; member dashboard NEEDS DEPLOY (feed loader ?v=328)
- **Was:** feed rows were tappable but connection events ("X added your passport", a notif linked to `#connections`) had no person id, so they couldn't open the person, and notif rows only guessed a panel by keyword.
- **DB (LIVE, migration `conn_panel_connection_feed`):** `member_connections_panel` now emits a `connection` feed type from `member_connections` (recent accepted + incoming pending) carrying the person — `link:'member:<id>'`, title "X added your passport"/"X wants to connect" — and EXCLUDES the duplicate `#connections` notifs. Verified: connection rows present with `member:` links, no leftover `#connections` notifs.
- **Loader (`assets/ffp-connections-feed-loader.js`):** `tap()` → `connection` opens that person's passport (`openCard`→`CollectionView.openPerson`); `notif` now delegates to the bell router `window.ffpHandleNotifClick(link)` so a notification opens its REAL target (activity card via `?activity=`, meetup, panel, URL) instead of guessing. Activity rows already → `ffpViewSharedActivity`. Include bumped ?v=327→328.
- **Verify:** open Connections → From your people; tap "X logged an activity" → activity card; tap "X added your passport" → their passport.

## LATEST 2026-06-19 (18) — Pro scheduling flow: service-driven online booking, session note, pause/resume, tap→people — NEEDS DEPLOY (PRO_BUILD=35; DB LIVE)
- **DB (LIVE, migrations `pro_service_online_and_slot_pause` + `fix_pro_list_slots_notes_online`):** `pro_services.bookable_online` bool added; `pro_save_service`/`pro_list_services` now persist+expose it. New `pro_set_slot_status(pro,id,active|paused)` + `pro_paused_slots(pro)`. `pro_list_slots` now returns `notes` + `bookable_online` — **and dropped a stale `sv.pricing_mode` reference that was making the function ERROR at runtime** (so the slot cache had been silently empty — the real cause of past slot-edit duplicate/"couldn't load" pain). All flows tested live + cleaned up.
- **Service editor (`ffp-professional-services-loader.js`):** "Offer online" toggle → `bookable_online`.
- **Scheduling (`ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js`):** slot editor gained a **Session note** field (`pro_slots.notes`, already persisted by `pro_save_slot`) + a read-only **online indicator** that follows the chosen service's Offer-online (via `_slUpdateOnline`, updated on service change). **Pause** button in the slot editor + a **Paused slots** strap under the schedule with **Resume** (`pauseSlot`/`resumeSlot`). Session-options sheet now has **Add or remove people** (`openSlotPeople`/`saveSlotPeople`, reuses `pro_save_slot` with only `client_ids`) and "Cancel this week" relabelled **Block this date**. PRO_BUILD 34→35.
- **Member self-booking = NOT in this repo:** booking lives on **findfitpeople.com** (separate platform). The `bookable_online` flag + active status are now ready for that platform to filter on (`service.bookable_online=true AND slot.status='active'`); wiring the member-facing self-book happens there (offer to add a `pro_bookable_slots` RPC when we touch it).

## LATEST 2026-06-19 (17) — Log Activity: tag training partners (passport connections, confirm-first) — DB LIVE; member dashboard NEEDS DEPLOY (FFP_BUILD=365)
- **Picker UX (FFP_BUILD=366):** the box IS the search input now (no separate button + search — saves the double-up). Empty/focused → dropdown of the **10 most trained-with** people (new RPC `member_frequent_partners(me,limit)` = accepted connections ranked by how often I've tagged them, then A–Z); typing filters ALL accepted connections. Suggestions drop under the input (absolute), close on outside tap, stay open for multi-add. `openLogWith`/`renderLogWithResults`/`_logRowHtml`/`_logConnById`.
- **Refinements (FFP_BUILD=365):** (a) "With" picker is now SEARCHABLE (sticky search box filters the connection list — built for 100s/1000s of connections), `renderLogWithResults(q)` filters, search/focus preserved on toggle. (b) Tagged members get a persistent "you've been tagged" strap under Log Activity (`#ffp-tagged-strap` → `openActivityTags()`, refreshed inside `loadNotifications` so it tracks pending count) — they can add tagged activities any time, not just from the bell. (c) High five moved from a full-width button to an ICON on the RIGHT of the shared-card owner row (opposite the name, under the photo): `#ffp-like-circle` (yellow when given) + count below; toggle handler updates the circle + number.
- **What:** member can add accepted connections to a logged activity; each gets a confirm/decline invite; on confirm the session shows on THEIR journey too.
- **DB (LIVE, migration `activity_partners_tagging`):** table `activity_partners(activity_id, partner_member_id, tagged_by, status pending/confirmed/declined, unique(activity,partner))`, RLS on (RPC-only). RPCs (SECURITY DEFINER): `activity_add_partners(me,activity,member_ids[])` (verifies ACCEPTED connection, inserts pending, notifies each), `activity_partner_respond(me,id,accept)` (only the tagged member; notifies tagger), `activity_pending_tags(me)`, `member_partner_activities(me)` (confirmed → journey), `activity_partners_for(activity)`. Full flow tested live (tag→pending→confirm→appears) then test data cleaned up.
- **Frontend (`ffp-member-dashboard.html`, reuses existing systems):** "Training partners (optional)" picker in Log Activity modal (multi-select from `member_connections_list`, accepted only) → on save calls `activity_add_partners` after `log_activity` returns the new id. Confirm UI = bell notification (link `#activity-tags`) → `openActivityTags()` modal (Confirm/Decline → `activity_partner_respond`). `loadJourneyLogs()` merges `member_partner_activities` into LOGS so confirmed shared sessions appear on the map/list. FFP_BUILD 363→364.
- **Reused, not reinvented:** notifications table, bell handler `ffpHandleNotifClick`, connections RPC, journey loader, `escHtml/escNotif`, `showToast`.
- **Verify:** deploy member dashboard; tag a connection on a new activity → they get a bell invite → Confirm → it appears on their journey.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (15) — Client edit = Given+Surname; REVERTED phone patches (no-patch rule) — NEEDS DEPLOY (PRO_BUILD=28)
- **NO-PATCH violation owned + reverted.** Had added inline styles to `_phoneField` AND duplicated the phone markup inline
  in the client loader to "force" it — both patches. Reverted: phone is the ONE component `_phoneField` (clean, class-based)
  + `.phone-input`/`.phone-cc`(width:96px, flex:0 0 96px)/`.phone-num`(flex:1 1 auto). Deep-checked: only one def of each,
  no conflicting rules → no CSS bug. The phone breakage seen was a STALE/WRONG live dashboard (it served the provider
  portal earlier today), not code. Fix = deploy the current dashboard. (Added RULE 0.5 to CLAUDE.md.)
- **Client edit form now Given names + Surname** (was single Full name) — `mm-given_names`/`mm-surname`; `saveMember`
  derives `full_name=(given+' '+surname)` and sends given_names/surname (pro_save_client persists them). Edit modal splits
  an existing full_name into given/surname for prefill. Gender/DOB/Nationality stay OUT of the form (pulled from Passport).
- **Feedback widget not sending — FIXED AT ROOT (DB, live):** migration `feedback_allow_professional_source` — the
  `feedback.source` CHECK only allowed member/provider; the pro dashboard sends 'professional' → every insert rejected.
  Widened CHECK to member/provider/professional/admin. `submit_feedback` just inserts; widget already sends 'professional'.
  Works now, no deploy.
- **Avatar not filling — NO code change (already correct, single source).** Topbar `.av-btn img{object-fit:cover}` +
  profile photo/cover use `background:center/cover`; only one avatar element, no conflicting rule.

- **2026-06-18 — ROOT CAUSES FOUND (the "nothing changes for 10 rounds" saga):**
  1. **"Wrong file deployed" was WRONG — it was a stale CDN cache.** Plain `web_fetch` of the pro dashboard URL
     returned the Partners (provider) portal; a CACHE-BUSTED fetch (`?cb=...`) returned the correct FFP Professional
     coach portal, and GitHub showed `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` v8 committed. The current file IS live. (RULE 1
     caveat in action — never declare a plain web_fetch the truth; always cache-bust.)
  2. **Header scrolling on mobile = `.app{height:100vh}`.** 100vh > visible viewport on phones → whole `.app` overflows
     → page scrolls the frozen topbar off. FIXED: `.app{height:100vh;height:100dvh}` (line 89) — single source, matches
     the modal-card pattern already in the file.
  3. **Phone / Given-Surname / save "never changing" = `PRO_BUILD` was not bumped after editing the client loader.**
     Dashboard requested `ffp-professional-client-loader.js?v=28`; the browser served the CACHED old loader at that
     unchanged URL, so the loader edits never reached the device. FIXED: `PRO_BUILD=29`. RULE going forward: **bump
     PRO_BUILD on EVERY pro-loader edit, no exceptions.** Added a visible `·b29` marker to the Edit-client modal title
     so the live device can confirm the new loader actually loaded (remove once confirmed).
  4. **VERSIONING CONVENTION (so progress is always knowable):** `PRO_BUILD` (in `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`)
     is THE single version number. Bump it on EVERY change (HTML or any pro loader). It cache-busts the lazy loaders
     AND is displayed live as **"Build N"** at the bottom of the avatar menu (set in the render fn: `av-build` ←
     `'Build '+PRO_BUILD`). To know what's live: open the avatar menu on the device and read the number. No more
     parallel `v7/v8`/`·b29` markers. Currently **Build 30**.
  - **Verified live/at-root this round:** `pro_save_client` persists the exact `saveMember` payload (given/surname/
    phone/tags/notes) — tested against the live DB. `_phoneField` is a true global (top-level in the `<script>` at 501).
    Phone CSS (`.phone-cc` 96px fixed + `.phone-num` flex, lines 193-195) and `.av-btn img{object-fit:cover}` (162) are
    correct in the live file.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (14) — Client profile shows passport fields; DON'T duplicate (pull from FFP account) — NEEDS DEPLOY (PRO_BUILD=26)
`ffp-professional-client-loader.js` `clientProfile`: now shows passport-style rows — Given name, Surname, Gender, Date of
birth, Email, Phone, Nationality — ALWAYS visible ("—" when empty); given/surname split from `full_name` for legacy
clients. Migration `pro_clients_passport_fields` added given_names/surname/gender/date_of_birth/nationality columns +
pro_save_client persists them (these are the FALLBACK for clients with NO FFP account).
- **Grant's steer: DON'T double up.** Did NOT expand the edit form to re-enter passport fields. The right fill is to PULL
  these from the client's FFP Passport/member record (single source) when they have an account.
- **PULL FROM PASSPORT — BUILT (Grant chose: auto on email match), PRO_BUILD=27.** Migration `pro_client_passport_pull`:
  `pro_client_passport(p_pro,p_client)` matches the client's email → FFP member and returns identity (given/surname/
  full_name/gender/date_of_birth/nationality/email/phone[cc+num]/passport_no/passport_active); scoped to the pro's own
  client. `clientProfile` renders local rows instantly, then async-pulls and upgrades `#cp-details` in place + shows a
  "Pulled from their FFP Passport" badge. (Identity only; health data stays behind the separate consent flow.) Verified:
  RPC returned Sunjay's full identity on email match, has_account:false otherwise (test client restored); JS isolation
  confirmed local→pulled upgrade. The pro_clients passport columns remain the fallback for clients with no FFP account.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (13) — Pro client panel: profile view + tags/phone-CC save fixes + form display — NEEDS DEPLOY (PRO_BUILD=24)
Deploy `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` (PRO_BUILD 23→24). DB migration
`pro_save_client_persist_tags` already LIVE.
- **Add-client form display:** phone CC field short (96px, 16px font) + number fills the row (`.phone-input width:100%`,
  `.phone-cc flex:0 0 96px`, `.phone-num flex:1 1 auto`); ALL inputs `font-size:16px` (no iOS zoom) + `min-height:44px`
  (fixes the half-height "Since" date field); removed the "Preview — professional portal in testing" pill.
- **Tags weren't saving (BUG):** `pro_save_client` never wrote `tags` (INSERT/UPDATE omitted it; column existed, all null).
  Fixed RPC to persist tags. `pro_list_clients` already returns it via `to_jsonb(c)`. DB round-trip verified.
- **Phone CC reverted to UAE (BUG):** `_phoneSet` only matched codes in `FFP_TAX.phoneCodes`; a saved code not in the list
  (e.g. +93) fell back to +971. Now it extracts the leading `+code` from the stored value and adds the option if missing,
  so it ALWAYS restores. Validated (+44 known, +93 unknown→restored, empty→default).
- **Client strap:** removed email AND phone (clean strap = name + tags + status). Tapping a strap now opens a **client
  PROFILE view** (`clientProfile`) with details + actions: Connect client Passport, Packages, Assessment form, Edit
  profile, Delete (footer). Inline strap action buttons removed.
- **`clientAssessment(id)` is a PLACEHOLDER** (toast) — awaiting Grant's spec: what the assessment form should capture +
  where it's stored. Build next.
- **PRO_BUILD=25 (2026-06-18):** phone field sizing moved INLINE onto `_phoneField` markup (CC `flex:0 0 96px`, number
  `flex:1 1 auto`) so it can't be broken by a stale/overriding `.phone-cc`/`.phone-num` class rule.
- **DEPLOY NOTE / why it looked unchanged:** the client-profile view + clean strap live in the LOADER, but the loader is
  only re-fetched when `PRO_BUILD` (inside `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`) changes AND the dashboard file is deployed.
  Deploying the loader alone does nothing (live dashboard requests the old ?v=). MUST deploy BOTH
  `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js`, then hard-refresh / reopen the PWA.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (12) — Pro scheduling: slot-edit DUPLICATE fix + service autofill/refresh — NEEDS DEPLOY (PRO_BUILD=22)
`ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js` (+ PRO_BUILD 21→22). **Confirmed real dup rows in DB** (e.g. provider a67378e3:
4 active slots all at the DEFAULT Mon 18:00 → edit modal opened in "New slot" mode because the `_proSlotsCache` lookup
missed, so save INSERTED with defaults instead of updating; also rapid-fire triples = double-submits).
- **`openSlotModal`:** if editing an id not in cache → `await _loadSlotsCache()`; if STILL missing → toast + abort (never
  fall through to a blank "New slot" that inserts a duplicate). Also `_ensureProSvc(true)` on every open so a just-added
  service appears in the picker (real-time).
- **`saveSlot`:** `_savingSlot` re-entry guard (blocks double-tap double-insert).
- **`_slSvcPick`:** now autofills duration + capacity + **location** from the chosen service (defaults).
- **"Who's in this slot":** removed the inline "Add a client by name" input — slot only SELECTS existing clients now;
  adding a client is Clients-tab only. Empty state points there.
- Validated via isolation harness (edit→reload→EDIT; truly-missing→ABORT; new→NEW; double-submit→BLOCKED; autofill OK).
- **NOTE — existing duplicate rows still in DB** (a67378e3 ×4 Mon 18:00; ff83faf4 several) — NOT auto-deleted (some may
  have clients/exceptions/bookings). Offer Grant a careful cleanup (keep the row with clients/exceptions, delete empties).
- **Still open (features, not bugs):** faster availability ("Mon–Fri 6AM–10AM" bulk setter — availability UI not yet
  located/built); slot delete control (single vs future ALREADY exists: "Cancel just this week" / "End slot"); change
  client timing (ALREADY exists: "Reschedule just this week" / "Shift this slot from now on").

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (11) — Pro Add-client modal tweaks — NEEDS DEPLOY (pro dashboard + client loader, PRO_BUILD=21)
`ffp-professional-client-loader.js` `openMemberModal`: Email + Phone fields → `.field full` (full-width rows); Notes
`rows 2→4` (double height). `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`: `.phone-cc` width `118px→92px` (+ right-pad 26→22) so the
country-code is narrower and the number (`.phone-num` flex:1) fills the rest — applies to every phone field (profile +
add-client). `PRO_BUILD 20→21` so the lazy client loader re-fetches. Deploy both files.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (10) — Map pins enriched + social share on own activity — NEEDS DEPLOY (member dashboard)
Member dashboard inline-script changes (deploy `ffp-member-dashboard.html`, hard-refresh; no asset ?v):
- **Map pins (own activities):** popup was "venue · N days ago". Now shows **Activity (title) · Duration · Date** + an
  **"Open activity"** link → `ffpViewSharedActivity(l.id)` (opens the existing activity card). Required adding `id: r.id`
  to the LOGS objects in `loadJourneyLogs` (they had no id before).
- **Social share (own activity):** `ffpRenderActivityCard` now stores `window._ffpActCard=a` and, for the OWNER, shows a
  yellow **Share** button → new `ffpSocialShareActivity(id)` = native share sheet (`navigator.share`: WhatsApp/IG/etc.)
  with an `?activity=<id>` link + summary text; desktop fallback copies the link. Existing in-app "Share with connections"
  kept (relabelled). Validated via isolation harness.
- **Reaction is called "HIGH FIVE"** (migrations `activity_high_five_wording` + `_v2`): button = "High five" → once
  given "High five given"; `front_hand` icon, FFP-yellow when given; notification = **"X gave you a High Five"** (body
  "Nice work on your <activity> — keep moving.", icon front_hand). Internal names stay `activity_likes` /
  `member_like_activity`. (Renamed from "Like" per Grant; "congratulate" reserved for PRs.)
- **Like/High-five on OTHERS' activities — DONE (migration `activity_likes_feature`, LIVE + member dashboard JS).** New
  `activity_likes` table (RLS on, no policies — definer RPCs only). `member_like_activity(p_me,p_id)` toggles a like
  (allowed if viewer owns it OR it's shared + connected), and on a NEW like pings the owner's bell (link
  `/ffp-member-dashboard.html?activity=<id>#panel-passport`, mirroring the share notification + congratulate). Extended
  `member_activity_view` to return `like_count` + `i_liked`. `ffpRenderActivityCard` non-owner branch now shows a Like
  button (filled red when liked, with count) → `ffpToggleActivityLike`. DB round-trip verified (like→count1→unlike→count0,
  left clean); JS isolation-validated. Owners never see Like; non-owners never see Share/Edit.
- **FUTURE — Garmin/Polar route map:** when device integrations land + GPS route stored, draw a Leaflet polyline on the
  card's existing `#ffp-act-map` location map. Parked.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (9) — Pro dashboard "redirects to passport" = WRONG FILE / stale deploy at that URL
Report: tapping the Professional webapp (PWA start_url `/ffp-professional-dashboard.html`) lands on the member
passport. Investigated end-to-end: pro dashboard `boot()` does NOT redirect to the member dashboard; shared
`ffp-api-integration.js` only guards member/provider paths; manifest start_url is correct; sw.js doesn't rewrite.
**Root cause (verified via web_fetch, twice incl. cache-bust):** the LIVE `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` returns the
**PARTNER/PROVIDER portal** content (`<title>FFP Passport — Partners Portal</title>`, "Sign in to your partner account")
— identical to local `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`. The local/workspace `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` is the CORRECT
coach portal (`<title>FFP Professional</title>`). So the wrong page is live at that filename (or a stale CDN copy — Rule 1
caveat: web_fetch can serve cached). NOT caused by this session's edits (they were on the correct coach file).
**Fix:** check GitHub `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` `<title>`: if "Partners Portal" → wrong content committed,
replace with the repo's real coach portal (title "FFP Professional") + deploy; if already "FFP Professional" → stale
Netlify/CDN cache → force fresh deploy + reinstall the webapp icon. Shared the correct file to Grant. Awaiting which title.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (8) — Billing emails: failed-payment recovery + trial-ending reminder — NEEDS DEPLOY + STRIPE
Deploy `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js`. Added two branded customer emails (reuse `mailer` + `brandEmail`):
- `sendPaymentFailedEmail` — on `invoice.payment_failed` (renewal card declined). Heads-up + "Update my card" CTA. Does NOT
  change access (Stripe retries; subscription.updated/deleted handles access). Handler `onInvoicePaymentFailed` resolves
  member by stripe_customer_id → email.
- `sendTrialEndingEmail` — on `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` (3 days before convert). Says the date + what they'll
  be charged ($149/yr or $20/mo from metadata.plan) + manage/cancel note. Handler `onTrialWillEnd` resolves member by
  metadata.member_id → customer → subscription; trial date from `sub.trial_end`.
- Webhook dispatch routes both new event types. Validated (node --check + run: both emails fire; non-sub invoice ignored).
- **Stripe step:** add these 2 events to the live webhook endpoint (total 7): `invoice.payment_failed`,
  `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`. (The other 5 were added 2026-06-18.) Events do nothing until the backend deploy.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (7) — Passport gate copy fix + CRITICAL billing bug (paying members locked out)
**(a) Gate copy fixed (deploy `ffp-member-dashboard.html`).** The subscription gate (`#ffp-pass-gate`, ~line 12783,
shown when `member_passport_active`=false) had off-brand copy. Now: headline "**The Active Lifestyle Community**"
(was "Your Passport unlocks the app"); body "**Passport holders can connect, meet up and engage with highly motivated
and active people — an environment for truly active people.**" (was the "passport & stamps, quests & challenges…" line).
Login signup screen (`login.html`) has separate copy — left as-is.
**(b) CRITICAL — valid Passport holders locked out (FIXED in DB, live).** Cause: the 7-day trial sets
`passport_expires_at` to the trial end; on trial→paid conversion that date was NOT being pushed out, so valid Passport
holders read as "expired" and got the paywall. Hit Hannah Wells (annual) + Vivian Aranha (monthly); would hit every
converting trial. (NB: a professional is just a valid Passport holder — no separate pro payment.)
- **Fix (migration `passport_active_subscription_safety_net`, LIVE):** both `member_passport_active` AND
  `pro_passport_active` now treat someone as a valid holder if expiry is current OR they have a live paid subscription
  (`stripe_subscription_id is not null and paid and membership<>'free'`). A real cancellation flips membership→'free' →
  still correctly blocked. Verified: Hannah/Vivian/Sunjay all active app+pro; 0 free members wrongly allowed. So a
  stale/late/missed renewal webhook can never again lock out a valid holder.
- **PROPER FIX (backend — deploy `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js`):** root cause = the conversion/renewal
  webhook events weren't extending the date (handler was correct; events likely not delivered). Three changes:
  (1) `setMemberFromSubscription` now reads `current_period_end` with a fallback to `sub.items.data[0].current_period_end`
  (newer Stripe API moved it to items) so a SDK/API bump can't silently null the expiry; (2) webhook now also handles
  `customer.subscription.created`; (3) NEW admin route **`POST /api/billing/resync`** (guard header
  `x-admin-key: <ADMIN_RESYNC_KEY>`) — loops every member with a `stripe_subscription_id`, re-reads the live Stripe sub,
  and writes the real status + period end. Validated (node --check + run: 401 w/o key, updates w/ key, item fallback works).
- **Grant's steps to fully close it:** (a) deploy the backend file; (b) set env `ADMIN_RESYNC_KEY` in Vercel;
  (c) in Stripe, ensure the webhook endpoint has `checkout.session.completed` + `invoice.paid` +
  `customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted` enabled and the signing secret matches `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`;
  (d) run once: `curl -X POST https://ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/api/billing/resync -H "x-admin-key: <KEY>"` →
  fixes all stuck dates from Stripe truth. AFTER dates verified correct, the RPC safety-net (migration
  `passport_active_subscription_safety_net`) can be removed if desired (it's then redundant).

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (6) — Professional profile fixes + login pathway — NEEDS DEPLOY
Deploy `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + `login.html` (inline scripts, no ?v bump). `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` was
touched then fully reverted — no net change.
- **Profession picker now full-screen** — `MemberProfile.openRolePicker()` was missing `fullBleed:true` (every other
  picker has it). Added it; retitled "Professional Role"→"Profession" + search/subtitle wording. Taxonomy + search
  already present (`FFP_PROFESSIONAL_ROLES`, grouped).
- **Profession now saves across refresh (BUG FIX).** Root cause (verified): backend PUT `/api/members/:id` (index.js
  ~line 2574) only persists a fixed field list (`preferences`, `skills`, …) and **drops a top-level `professional`**, so it
  was never stored. Frontend-only fix (no backend redeploy): `saveProfile` mirrors `professional` INTO `preferences` (which
  IS persisted), hydration reads `m.preferences.professional` as fallback. Round-trip validated.
- **Professional login pathway no longer bounced to member Passport.** `login.html` launch auto-redirect (~line 729) sent
  any existing session to the member dashboard with portal defaulting to 'member'. Now honors `?portal=professional` (or
  `#professional`): sets `selectedPortal='professional'` before the redirect → `handleAuthRedirect` routes a signed-in pro
  to `ffp-professional-dashboard.html`. Fresh Professional-tile sign-in already worked.
- **Passport requirement: NOT duplicated.** It already exists server-side — `pro_passport_active(member)` is the single
  source of truth, enforced by `professional_link` (→`passport_inactive`) and surfaced via `professional_for_member`'s
  `passport_active`/`can_access`. A client-side `_hasValidPassport` + `needpass` gate was added then REVERTED to avoid
  drift. Same email = same account across Passport / Professional dashboard / findfitpeople.com → one passport status.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (5) — FIX: members had no route into the Professional portal (Sunjay onboarding) — NEEDS DEPLOY
Report: Sunjay (first-time pro) signed in, was NOT asked for professional setup, landed on an empty Passport.
**Diagnosed (tool-verified, not guessed):**
- Sunjay (`9d550bd3…`, sunjay@findfitpeople.com) = role `member`, `paid=true`, `membership='passport'`,
  passport_expires 2027-06-08 (ACTIVE), and **no `professionals` row**.
- `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` `boot()` (line ~1080) is CORRECT: signed-in member + `professional_for_member`
  returns null → `paintOnboard()` + `showGateState('onboard')`. So reaching that page WOULD show the setup form.
- Root cause = he never reached it. `login.html` (lines ~729-731) auto-redirects any existing session via
  `handleAuthRedirect` on load, with `selectedPortal` still defaulting to `'member'` → member dashboard. A signed-in
  member is bounced to their Passport before they can tap the Professional tile. No entry from member → pro dashboard.
- (Aside: the member profile's self-declared "professional role" picker — ffp-member-dashboard ~line 8265 — is cosmetic
  and unrelated to the real Professionals Portal / `professionals` table.)
- **Fix attempt (REMOVED 2026-06-18):** added a "Professional portal" item to the member account menu →
  `window.location.href='ffp-professional-dashboard.html'`. It didn't navigate cleanly (the user-menu's delegated
  panel-switch handler swallowed the click — it just stayed on the Passport), so per Grant it was REMOVED. The real route
  into the pro portal is the login pathway fix (LATEST (6)): `login.html?portal=professional` / Professional tile.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (4) — QUESTS proof: audit + NEW qr_gps (Scan QR + GPS) combined proof — NEEDS DEPLOY (v9/v61)
Goal: make quest proofs actually usable. **Audit (verified this turn):** the Admin Reviews queue IS wired
(`quest_pending_completions` + `quest_verify_completion`, Approve/Reject in the Reviews tab), so pending
photo/partner/referral submissions can be signed off today. **qr / gps / photo / photo_gps all work**
(`member_quest_complete_task`). **`auto` does NOT work** — RPC returns `auto_task`; `quest_tasks.rule` jsonb exists but
nothing consumes it (auto-engine = still to build; see Open/next).
- **NEW combined `qr_gps` proof (built, LIVE DB + needs JS deploy):** member must scan the correct QR **and** be within the
  radius (defaults **250m**). Migration `quest_proof_qr_gps_combined`: `quest_save_task` now auto-gens a `qr_token` for
  `qr_gps` too; `member_quest_complete_task` has a `qr_gps` branch (bad_code → too_far(distance_m) → verified).
  Admin builder: PROOFS gained `['qr_gps','Scan QR + GPS']`, `qtProofChange` shows the GPS row for it + defaults radius 250,
  `saveTask` sends lat/lng/radius for qr_gps. Member: PROOF map `qr_gps` + `doTask` qr_gps branch (prompt code → getGeo →
  `_complete({scanned_code,lat,lng})`). Validated via isolation harness (node --check OK).
- Maps to Grant's examples: "visit a location"=gps (works), "completed task"=qr (works), "attend an event"=**qr_gps** (new).

**AUTO check-in engine — DESIGNED, awaiting Grant's go (NOT built):** two flavours requested — (a) a SPECIFIC partner
session/listing auto-completes on check-in, and (b) a GLOBAL "attend any matching space near you, anywhere" push. Plan: a
`rule` jsonb schema (match by listing_id | provider_id | activity/category | any) + an engine invoked from the existing
check-in RPCs (`venue_checkin_session`/`booking_checkin`/`member_event_checkin`/`venue_checkin_activity`/`pro_checkin_service`,
"depends on the task") that, on check-in, finds active `auto` tasks the member is enrolled in whose rule matches and inserts
a verified completion (wrapped so a quest error can NEVER block a check-in). Confirm matching granularity + which triggers
before building (touches live check-in paths).

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (3) — Challenges panel parked (hide on member, grey-out in admin) — NEEDS DEPLOY
Grant: park Challenges for a future feature. Code untouched — only entry points changed (reversible).
- **Member (`ffp-member-dashboard.html`):** bottom-nav Challenges button (`data-panel="panel-challenges"`, line ~5404)
  now `style="display:none;"`. Panel div `#panel-challenges` left intact but unreachable. Restore = remove the inline style.
- **Admin (`ffp-admin-dashboard.html`):** sidebar link (line ~1477) greyed + non-clickable — removed `onclick`, added
  `aria-disabled`, `style="opacity:.45;pointer-events:none;cursor:default;"` + a "Soon" tag. Panel/loader/panelNames
  untouched. Restore = re-add `onclick="App.go('panel-challenges')"`, drop the style + Soon tag.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 (2) — FIX: Log Activity modal inherited previous entry's input — NEEDS DEPLOY
Report (Sunjay Vyas): opening the passport-panel "Log Activity" modal for a NEW activity showed input left over from his
last upload. **Root cause (verified):** `openLogModal()` reset distance/HR/pin/photo/date/time/duration/country/city but
NOT `log-activity`, `log-calories`, `log-notes` — those are only written in edit mode (`openLogModalForEdit`), and
`saveLog()` success path just calls `closeLogModal()` (hides, no reset). So after any save, the next fresh open kept the old
Activity name, Calories and Notes.
- **Fix (`ffp-member-dashboard.html`, in `openLogModal`):** the "fresh form" block now also clears `log-activity`,
  `log-calories`, `log-notes`. Edit mode unaffected — `openLogModalForEdit` calls `openLogModal` first, then re-applies row
  values. No DB change. Inline script in the page → no asset ?v bump; deploy the HTML + hard-refresh.

## LATEST 2026-06-18 — QUESTS polish: card/preview height, partner filter, gender leaderboard — NEEDS DEPLOY (v8/v60)
Grant's 4 asks, all done & verified. **2 JS files + 2 cache-busts to deploy; 2 DB migrations already LIVE.**
- **Headline (major) card 2× taller:** `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` `_ensureCss` `.q-major min-height 138px → 276px`.
- **Admin hero-image preview 2× taller:** `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` `#q-hero-preview` inline `height:150px → 300px`.
- **Partner section showing a stray quest — ROOT CAUSE:** `member_quests_feed` partner branch selected ANY
  `owner_type<>'ffp'` joined quest with NO status filter, so Grant's own ended, member-created "Fitness Class Quest"
  appeared under Partner. **Fix (migration `quests_feed_partner_hide_ended`, LIVE):** partner branch now also requires
  `coalesce(status,'')<>'ended'` and `(active_to is null or active_to>=now())`. Per Grant's call = "just hide ended ones"
  (live member-created quests still show). Verified: partner count for grant@findfitpeople.com = 0.
- **Gender filter in quest detail leaderboard:** Grant wanted "a filter button with all options inside" (matches the app's
  tune/Filters pattern). Board pane rebuilt: a **Filters button** (tune icon + yellow count badge) toggles `#q-board-panel`
  holding Location chips (Global/My country/My city) **+ Gender chips (All/Men/Women)**; they combine. New state
  `boardGender`; handlers `boardGenderFilter`, `toggleBoardFilters`, `_updateFilterBadge`; `boardFilter` scoped its query to
  `.q-chip[data-scope]` (was hitting all chips). `loadQuestBoard` passes `p_gender` when set. New CSS + id bumped to v8.
  - **Migration `quest_leaderboard_add_gender` (LIVE):** dropped 2-arg + 5-arg overloads, recreated as ONE
    `quest_leaderboard(p_quest,p_limit,p_city,p_country,p_search,p_gender)` (single fn → no overload ambiguity; old client
    calling without p_gender still resolves). `members.gender` = 'Male'/'Female'. All 3 call shapes tested OK.
- **Cache-busts:** member dashboard quests-core `?v=7 → ?v=8`; admin `_lazyInit v=59 → v=60`.
- Validated: edited quests-core region extracted to a standalone harness → `node --check` OK + ran (board pane returns a
  string). Admin edit was a 3-char inline height swap. (Bash mount serves STALE/truncated copies of these files —
  quests-core mount=698 lines vs host 856, admin mount cut at 274 — so full-file `node --check` over the mount is invalid;
  trusted Read/Edit + isolation harness per Rule 3.)

## LATEST 2026-06-17 (6) — MEMBER quests: gamification pass (accordion tasks, progress loop) — NEEDS DEPLOY (v7)
Grant: kill "mission" wording; major card shouldn't show "N tasks/P pts"; task list = tap-to-expand accordion; must clearly
show completion; make it addictive. Done in `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=7):
- Word "mission" GONE — section is now "More quests".
- **Major card**: no task/points stats. Not joined → "Start the quest" CTA. Joined → a filling **progress bar** + "Continue".
  Complete → "Quest complete" trophy. (Progress is the hook, not cold counts.)
- **List rows**: joined → mini progress bar + chevron (or trophy if done); not joined → social proof ("N playing") + Join.
- **Detail = the dopamine loop**: a **progress hero** (big bar that animates from 0→% on open, done/total, points climbing,
  rank to chase) + **Tasks | Leaderboard** toggle. Tasks are an **accordion** (`taskAccordion`/`toggleTask`): tap a task →
  expands to "How to complete" + the action button; only one open at a time. **Completion is obvious**: filled green check,
  row tints green, points tag turns green, progress bar advances on reload. Leaderboard tab filterable (global/country/city + search).
- Validated (edited region node-checked OK). **Deploy member dashboard + quests-core v7. DB already live.**

## LATEST 2026-06-17 (5) — MEMBER quests panel REBUILT to Major / Minor / Partner (mockup) — NEEDS DEPLOY
Killed Explore/My-quests tabs and the 2-col "giant square" cards. Member panel is now exactly: **MAJOR quest** (one
headline, compact full-width banner) → **Minor quests** ("FFP missions", compact full-width list rows) → **Partner quests**
(only shown if the member has unlocked any; compact rows w/ lock badge). Designed to scale (rows, not squares).
- **DB `member_quests_feed`** now returns `{major, minor, partner}` (was headline/explore/mine). `minor`=FFP non-headline
  public live (with joined flag + my_completed); `partner`=joined non-FFP quests (provider_name). Back-compat keys still read.
- **DB `quest_leaderboard`** extended: `(p_quest, p_limit, p_city, p_country, p_search)` — filterable Global/Country/City +
  name search, returns city too. Defaults null = old behaviour. **Both DB changes already LIVE (no deploy).**
- **Major-quest detail modal redesigned for scale:** slim cover+title, one compact stat strip (pts · rank · done — no big
  squares), a **Tasks | Leaderboard** segmented toggle. Tasks = compact rows in a **scroll container (max-h 54vh)** → handles
  100+ tasks. Leaderboard = **filter chips (Global/My country/My city) + name search + scrollable top-50** → handles 10k users.
- `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` rewritten (state major/minor/partner; renderAll/renderMajor/rowMinor/rowPartner; compact
  taskRow; questPane/boardFilter/boardSearchInput/loadQuestBoard; self-injected CSS `ffp-quests-v6-css`; removed dead
  loadBoard/renderBoard + cat/scope/tab listeners). Member-created exploration-quest code preserved but unsurfaced.
- `ffp-member-dashboard.html`: #panel-quests = `#quest-hero` (major) + `#quest-sections` (minor+partner); tabs/grid removed;
  quests-core bumped **?v=6**. Validated (edited region node-checked OK; file closes clean at 762). **Deploy member dashboard + quests-core v6.**

## LATEST 2026-06-17 (4) — QUESTS upload: RESOLVED via storage RLS policy rebuild (DB, no deploy)
Even with a valid `authenticated` admin JWT, storage kept returning 403 "new row violates RLS" on quest-images — yet
DB probes proved anon+authenticated CAN insert (RLS enforced; control test on payout-receipts correctly failed), the
bucket is public with no mime/size limit, and **quest-images already had 8 objects** (last upload Jun 16) while **avatars
got an upload today** under a STRICTER policy. Same authenticated role passing avatars' is_admin() check but failing
quest-images' looser bucket_id check ⇒ the quest-images policies were in a stale/broken state, not being evaluated by storage.
- **Fix (migration `quest_images_storage_policies_rebuild`):** dropped the 6 old "quest-images insert/update (anon|public)"
  policies and recreated clean consolidated ones — `quest_images_insert` (INSERT TO anon,authenticated check bucket_id),
  `quest_images_update` (UPDATE same), `quest_images_read` (SELECT TO public). Recreating refreshes storage's policy state.
- Re-probed after: anon_ok=t, auth_ok=t. **Server-side only — NO redeploy.** Admin just retries the upload (JS already v59).
- If it ever recurs: definitive fallback is a backend (service-role) upload endpoint that bypasses storage RLS entirely.

## LATEST 2026-06-17 (3) — QUESTS admin upload: REAL fix = auth as admin JWT, not anon — NEEDS DEPLOY (v59)
Live console (v58) finally gave the real error: `POST …/quest-images/… 400` → body
`{"statusCode":"403","error":"Unauthorized","message":"new row violates row-level security policy"}`. So it was never a
hang OR the JWT wrapper — the **anon-only** upload I'd switched to was rejected by storage RLS. DB probe (set role anon /
authenticated, insert into storage.objects bucket_id='quest-images') proved **both roles CAN insert** at the DB level, and
the hardcoded anon key matches the project's current anon key exactly — yet the live anon request still 403'd (storage role
mismatch). 
- **Fix:** `uploadHero` now sends `Authorization: Bearer <admin JWT>` via `window.FFPAuth.getJwt()` (role=authenticated —
  the same identity that loads all admin data + passes is_admin(), and how every other bucket upload in the app authenticates),
  falling back to the anon key only if no JWT. Still direct native fetch + raw file (no compress) + full breadcrumb logs incl.
  which token was used and exact HTTP status/body.
- **Cache-bust `v=58 → v=59`.** Deploy BOTH files + hard-refresh. Console should now show `auth token: admin JWT (…)` →
  `upload response status: 200` → `upload OK →`.

## LATEST 2026-06-17 (2) — QUESTS admin upload: removed canvas compression (was hanging) — NEEDS DEPLOY (v58)
Live console (Grant, incognito) confirmed `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js?v=57` IS loaded and there was **no upload error
logged** — meaning the upload wasn't erroring, it was silently never completing. Cause: `uploadHero` did
`await compressImage(file)`, and `compressImage` resolves only inside `canvas.toBlob(cb)`. That callback can **never fire**
for some images (large / HEIC / memory pressure), so the await hangs forever — dead button, stuck "Uploading…" toast, no error.
- **Fix:** `uploadHero` now uploads the **RAW file** (no canvas/compress step at all) via the same direct-REST native fetch
  + anon key. Added breadcrumb `console.log`s (uploadHero fired / file name+type+size / POST url / response status / OK or
  error) so it can NEVER be silent again — next attempt leaves a visible trail. Accept ext now includes heic/heif.
- **Cache-bust `v=57 → v=58`** in `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`. Deploy BOTH files + hard-refresh.
- If it still fails after this, the console will now show exactly where (e.g. `upload response status: 400` + body) — paste that.

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — QUESTS admin: image upload ROOT-CAUSE fix (direct REST, native fetch) — NEEDS DEPLOY
The admin quest hero image upload kept failing. **Root cause (verified, not guessed this time):** uploads went through
`window.supabase.storage`, and `window.supabase` is built in `assets/ffp-api-integration.js` with a custom `global.fetch`
wrapper that **overrides `Authorization` with `FFPAuth.getJwt()`** on every request. In the admin app that injected member
JWT is stale/wrong for Storage, so the upload was rejected and the SDK error was swallowed into a vague toast. (Bucket +
policies are fine — `quest-images` is public with INSERT policies for anon/authenticated/public; confirmed via DB.)
- **Fix in `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js`:** `uploadHero()` now uploads with **native `window.fetch` directly to the Storage
  REST endpoint** (`POST /storage/v1/object/quest-images/<path>`) using the **anon apikey for both `apikey` and
  `Authorization`** — bypassing the SDK and the JWT-injecting wrapper entirely. Anon has an INSERT policy so it always works
  regardless of session state. Public URL built directly. On failure it now surfaces the **exact HTTP status + body** in the
  toast + console (no more silent failures). compressImage still runs with raw-file fallback.
- **Cache-bust bumped `v=56 → v=57`** in `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` `_lazyInit` — **this is essential**: the loader URL only
  changes when this version bumps, so without it the browser keeps serving the cached OLD loader (a likely reason earlier
  fixes "didn't take"). Deploy BOTH `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`.

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — QUESTS: HEADLINE/FEATURED quest on member panel (mockup match) — NEEDS DEPLOY
Member Quests panel reworked to the agreed mockup: **one big headline (flagship) FFP quest at the top**, click → modal
with all its tasks + tasks-completed + leaderboard; **minor FFP (category) quests listed below** to join. Killed the "FFP
Points" stat hero, the "Create your own quest" button, and the partner-code button from the public panel.
- **DB migration `quests_headline_flag_feed` (LIVE):** added `quests.is_headline boolean default false`. Rewrote
  **`member_quests_feed(p_me)`** → now returns `{ headline, explore, mine }`: `headline` = the single FFP public+live
  `is_headline` quest (with `my_points`/`my_completed`/`joined`/`joined_count`/`task_count`/`points_total`), `explore` =
  other FFP public+live quests not joined (headline excluded), `mine` = joined. Updated **`admin_save_quest`** for `is_headline`.
- **`assets/ffp-quests-core.js` v3 → cache-bust `?v=5`:** `load()` reads headline/explore/mine; **`renderHero()`**
  rewritten to a big clickable featured headline card (hero image/gradient bg, "Featured quest" pill, title, "N tasks · P
  pts", "N joined", Join/Continue); **`render()`** shows "More FFP quests" + minor cards (Leaderboard tab removed);
  **`openTaskDetail()`** now appends a Leaderboard section + new **`loadQuestBoard()`** (`quest_leaderboard`, medal ranks).
  Member-created exploration quests PRESERVED but no longer surfaced in Explore.
- **`ffp-member-dashboard.html`:** #panel-quests now Explore + My quests only (removed Leaderboard tab, scope-seg, cat
  row, Create + partner-code buttons); subhead reworded; `#quest-hero` renders the headline card; quests-core bumped `?v=5`.
- **`ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` v3:** full-screen editor; New-FFP-quest form has **"Headline quest" checkbox `q-headline`**;
  `save()` payload sets `is_headline` + (NOT-NULL fix) `eligibility:'all', require_distinct_venues:false`; "task" wording;
  **`uploadHero()` hardened** (raw-file fallback if canvas compress fails, real error surfaced). Inline Tasks builder + Reviews tab.
- **`ffp-admin-dashboard.html`:** `_lazyInit` global admin-loader cache-bust bumped to **`v=56`** (must deploy so new loader loads).
- Validated (mount truncates these large files → false EOF at 682/274; Read confirms whole: core 714 lines closes 712–713,
  admin 388 closes IIFE 387; changed methods isolation-parsed OK). **Deploy 4 files; then Admin → Quests, tick "Headline
  quest" on the flagship quest + set it Live so the member hero populates.**

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — QUESTS REBUILD (Phase 1 of 4: data model + RPCs) — BACKEND LIVE, verified
Rethink: quests become **points-scored mission checklists with proof**, on a **leaderboard**. Strategy locked with Grant:
**FFP quests = the public, global focus of the Passport** (acquisition engine → pulls in partners); **partner quests =
members-only, unlocked via QR/link** (retention tool), never shown in the public feed or global rankings.
Member Passport is the deliverable; **authoring stays in partner + admin dashboards** (existing builds, extended in Phase 4).
- NEW **`quest_tasks`** (missions): title, instruction, **points**, `proof_type` (auto|qr|photo|gps|photo_gps|partner|referral),
  `verifier` (auto|partner|admin), optional `provider_id`, GPS `lat/lng/radius_m`, `qr_token`, `rule` jsonb (for auto).
- NEW **`quest_task_completions`** (the proof): `proof_photo_url`, `lat/lng`, `scanned_code`, `note`, status
  (pending|verified|rejected), `points_awarded`. Unique (task, member).
- **`quests`** extended: `visibility` (public|unlock), `unlock_code` (partner QR/link), `leaderboard` (global|quest|none),
  `points_total`. Relaxed legacy NOT NULLs (stamp_id, target_count) + added `reward_type='points'` to the check. **`quest_progress`**
  gained cached `points`; status stays `in_progress`|`completed`.
- RPCs (all GRANTed): `member_quests_feed` (Explore = public FFP not-joined; Mine = joined), `member_quest_detail`
  (tasks + my_state + my_points + my_rank), `member_quest_join` (blocks unlock-only), `member_quest_unlock(code)`,
  `member_quest_complete_task(member,task,{photo_url,lat,lng,scanned_code,note})` — validates per proof type (QR token match;
  GPS within radius via `ffp_haversine_m`; photo required; partner/referral → pending), auto-verifies or queues, awards points,
  flips quest to completed when all tasks verified. Leaderboards: `quest_leaderboard(quest)` + **`ffp_global_leaderboard(city,country,limit)`**
  → **city / country / global ambassador boards** (sums points across FFP quests; members carry city+country).
- Live-tested end-to-end (QR +5 verified, photo+GPS in-range +5 verified, photo→partner pending 0, dedupe, detail, all 3
  leaderboards, feed) then cleaned up. **No deploy this phase (DB only).**
**Phase 2 (member Passport UI, NEEDS DEPLOY)** — rebuilt `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` **v3** + #panel-quests tabs:
- Tabs now **Explore / My quests / Leaderboard** (was Discover/My/Completed). Explore = public FFP quests
  (`member_quests_feed`); My quests = joined (FFP + partner + member-created); Leaderboard = **city/country/global**
  ambassador board (`ffp_global_leaderboard`, scope via the existing scope-seg, shown only on that tab). Hero shows
  the member's FFP points + global rank.
- Quest detail (`openTaskDetail` → `member_quest_detail`) = **mission checklist**; each task completed with proof via
  `member_quest_complete_task`: QR (prompt code), photo (FFPUpload), GPS (`navigator.geolocation`), photo+GPS, or
  partner/referral (submits as pending). Errors mapped (bad_code, too_far w/ distance, need_location/photo).
- **Partner quests unlock** via "Have a partner code? Unlock" button → `member_quest_unlock(code)` → opens it.
- **Preserved** member-created exploration quests verbatim: create/edit/photo/invite + old venue detail (`openMemberDetail`,
  still uses /api/quests + member_save_quest + member_quest_venues/participants). They no longer show in Explore
  (Explore = FFP only, by design) but remain in My quests once joined. JS validated (node --check, 698 lines).
- DEPLOY: `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (v3) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (tabs relabel, unlock button, cache-bust ?v=3).
  Next: Phase 3 auto-rule engine, Phase 4 dashboard authoring (task builder + QR/unlock) + verify queues.
**Phase 4a (authoring + verify RPCs) — DB LIVE, verified.** (UI still to come.)
- `admin_save_quest(id,p)` upsert FFP quest (owner_type ffp, visibility public, leaderboard). `provider_quest_meta(provider,id,p)`
  sets partner quest visibility=unlock + generates `unlock_code` + leaderboard. `quest_save_task(quest,id,p)` /
  `quest_delete_task(id)` / `quest_list_tasks(quest)` — task builder (auto-generates `qr_token` for qr tasks; `_quest_recount`
  keeps points_total + legacy target_count in sync). Verify queue: `quest_pending_completions(provider|null)` (provider=their
  tasks, null=admin all) + `quest_verify_completion(id,'approve'|'reject',by)` (approve awards points + advances quest_progress).
- Live-tested: create FFP quest → add QR(+5,auto) & photo(+10,partner) tasks → points_total 15 → member submitted photo →
  pending queue showed proof → approve → +10 awarded, progress 1/2. Cleaned up. **Pending: admin task-builder UI (so Explore
  has content), partner task-builder + unlock/QR UI, verify-queue UIs.**
**Phase 4b (admin authoring UI, NEEDS DEPLOY)** — rebuilt `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` **v3**:
- Admin Quests screen reshaped to the points/missions model. New FFP quest form (title/desc/category/scope/city-country/
  **leaderboard**/hero) writes to `quests` directly (admin RLS) as owner_type=ffp, visibility=public, reward_type=points.
- **Missions builder** (inline, appears once the quest is saved): add/edit/delete missions via `quest_save_task` /
  `quest_list_tasks` / `quest_delete_task` — each with points, proof type, verifier, optional venue, GPS lat/lng/radius;
  QR token auto-generated + shown for qr missions. List shows points_total + mission count.
- **Reviews tab** — `quest_pending_completions(null)` lists pending photo/partner submissions with the proof image →
  Approve/Reject via `quest_verify_completion`. Publish/pause/end unchanged. Dropped the old stamp/sponsor/venue form
  (legacy quests still display; admin now authors FFP points quests). JS validated (340 lines, balanced).
- DEPLOY: `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (global loader cache-bust v52→**v53**).
  Once deployed: New FFP quest → add missions → Publish → it appears in the member Passport Explore feed.
- Remaining Phase 4: partner task-builder + unlock/QR UI (ffp-provider-quest-create-loader.js) + partner verify queue (Check-ins).
**Phase 4b.1 (polish, NEEDS DEPLOY):** (1) **Passport nav** — un-hid the Quests bottom-nav button in `ffp-member-dashboard.html`
(was `display:none`); Quests is now reachable on the Passport. (2) Admin quest editor is now **full-screen** (`openSheet`,
not the small centered modal). (3) **Taxonomy-driven**: category from `FFP_TAX.categories` (fallback to the 6 standard);
Country + City are dependent dropdowns from `FFP_TAX.cities` (was free text). DEPLOY: `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js`
(+ admin dashboard already at loader cache-bust v53) and `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (nav).
**Phase 4b.2 (cleanup, NEEDS DEPLOY):** Member Quests panel stripped to the mockup — **removed "Create your own quest"
+ "Have a partner code? Unlock" buttons and the category row**; panel now = hero + tabs (Explore/My quests/Leaderboard)
+ FFP quest cards only. Subhead reworded. (Member-created create/invite code stays in quests-core but is no longer
surfaced; partner quests will unlock via QR/link later.) Admin editor: **full-screen** confirmed, hero image box now
**click-to-upload** (was easy to miss), and **mission→task** wording everywhere (admin + member: "Tasks", "Add task").
DEPLOY: `ffp-member-dashboard.html` + `assets/ffp-quests-core.js` (?v=**4**) + `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` +
`ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (admin loader cache-bust v53→**v54**).
**Phase 4b.3 (bug fixes, NEEDS DEPLOY):** (1) **Quest save was failing** — `quests.eligibility` + `require_distinct_venues`
are NOT NULL and the admin insert omitted them; now sets `eligibility:'all'`, `require_distinct_venues:false` (verified a
clean insert). (2) **Hero upload hardened** — uploads the raw file (canvas compress now optional w/ fallback), surfaces the
real error string, click-to-upload box. (3) `taxCats()` pinned to the 6 DB-enforced categories (avoids category-check
violations). DEPLOY: `ffp-admin-quests-loader.js` + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (loader cache-bust v54→**v55**).

## LATEST 2026-06-16 — APPOINTMENTS / PT system (Phase 1 of 5: data model + config) — BACKEND LIVE
New facility-side PT/appointment system, kept **separate** from the group-class Sessions timetable. Phase 1 (DB only,
no deploy needed) is live in Supabase. Trainer profiles **reuse `provider_staff`** (no new table).
New tables + config RPCs:
- **`provider_services`** — facility services (one_on_one/group/assessment), `price_aed`, `duration_min`, `capacity`,
  **`tax_rate` (per-service %)**, status. RPCs: `provider_list_services` (includes nested `coaches`), `provider_save_service`, `provider_delete_service`.
- **`provider_service_coaches`** — coach↔service link carrying the **commission deal**: `commission_type` `percent`|`flat` +
  `commission_value`. RPCs: `provider_save_service_coach` (upsert on service+staff), `provider_delete_service_coach`.
- **`provider_trainer_slots`** — recurring weekly availability (staff, optional service, day_of_week 0-6, slot_time, duration).
  RPCs: `provider_list_trainer_slots`, `provider_save_trainer_slot`, `provider_delete_trainer_slot`.
- **`provider_packages`** — PT package catalog: N `sessions_count` of a service, `price_aed`, `tax_rate`, `validity_days`.
  RPCs: `provider_list_packages`, `provider_save_package`, `provider_delete_package`.
- All GRANTed to anon, authenticated. Live-tested create→link→list, then cleaned up.
**Phase 2 (DB only, LIVE)** — booking engine + client packages + status flow:
- **`provider_client_packages`** — a client's bought package w/ `sessions_remaining`. RPCs: `provider_sell_package`
  (assign to member, sets remaining/expiry from catalog), `provider_list_client_packages(provider[,member])`.
- **`provider_appointments`** — booked sessions. RPCs: `provider_book_appointment(provider, jsonb)` (package path
  decrements + payment_status='package'; single path cash/card/comp/unpaid; **coach overlap guard**; snapshots
  price/tax_rate/commission), `provider_reschedule_appointment`, `provider_cancel_appointment` (restores a package
  session), `provider_checkin_appointment`, `provider_trainer_complete_appointment` (→completed_pending),
  `provider_confirm_appointment` (→completed; **freezes tax_aed + commission_aed (coach payout) + payout_aed (facility
  net)** — coach only paid once facility-confirmed), `provider_appointment_no_show` (default consumes session, no
  commission), `provider_list_appointments(provider, from, to)`.
- Live-tested: 10-pack @1800 → per-session 180, tax 5% =9, commission 60% =108, **facility net 63**; sessions 10→9;
  overlap correctly blocked (coach_busy); cancel restored the session. Cleaned up. Phases left: 4 reports, 5 admin.
**Phase 3 (UI, NEEDS DEPLOY)** — new **Appointments** panel in Business nav (between Sessions & Staff).
- New file **`ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js` v1** (lazy via `_provLoaderSrc['appointments']?v=1`); `renderAppointments()`
  hook in showPanel. Trainer profiles reuse Staff. Tabs:
  - **Calendar** — week nav; appointment cards w/ status + payment chips; actions by state: Check in → Mark done
    (trainer) → **Confirm completed** (facility, shows frozen value/tax/coach/net); Reschedule, No-show, Cancel.
  - **Services & Coaches** — CRUD services (price/duration/tax%/capacity); link coaches w/ **% or flat** commission.
  - **Availability** — recurring weekly trainer slots (coach/service/day/time), grouped by coach.
  - **Packages** — package catalog CRUD + **Sell to client** + **client packages list with a sessions-remaining bar**.
  - Book modal: service→auto-duration + narrows coach list; client picker (provider_searchable_members);
    pay = package (loads that client's active packages) / cash / card / comp / unpaid.
**Phase 4 (reports, NEEDS DEPLOY)** — `provider_appointments_report(provider, from, to)` → summary (booked/completed/
pending/no-show/cancelled, gross/tax/commission/net on completed only, unpaid count+amount) + by_coach + by_service.
New **Reports** tab in the Appointments panel (range selector: this/last month, last 30, this year, all) — money KPIs,
session-count KPIs, and by-coach / by-service tables. (Same `ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js`.)
**Phase 5 (admin, NEEDS DEPLOY)** — new **Appointments** item in admin sidebar (after Payouts).
- RPCs: `admin_client_packages(q)` (every client package across facilities + sessions-remaining, searchable),
  `admin_appointments_overview(from,to)` (platform totals + by-provider), `admin_appointments_list(from,to,provider)`
  (every session detail row). New file **`ffp-admin-appointments-loader.js`** (`window.AdminAppts`, lazy via
  `_panelScript['panel-appointments']`, global `?v=52`). Tabs: **Sessions remaining** (client table w/ remaining bar) +
  **Sessions report** (KPIs + by-facility + full detail list).
- DEPLOY (all 4 + this doc): `ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js` (new), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`,
  `ffp-admin-appointments-loader.js` (new), `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`.
**APPOINTMENTS SYSTEM COMPLETE (Phases 1–5).** Backend (Phases 1,2,4,5 RPCs) is live in Supabase; the 4 UI files need deploying.

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — Availability = WINDOWS + BLOCKS (per coach) — backend LIVE, UI needs deploy
Reworked trainer availability (per coach/trainer/teacher) from single slots to **hours windows + blocks**:
- `provider_trainer_slots` gained **start_time/end_time** (a day's available window; slot_time kept = start for compat).
  `provider_save_trainer_slot` now takes start_time/end_time (validates end>start); list returns them.
- NEW **`provider_trainer_blocks`** — unavailable periods per coach: `block_type` `recurring`(weekly, day_of_week) |
  `date`(one-off); `start_time`/`end_time` **NULL = whole day off**; reason. RPCs `provider_list/save/delete_trainer_block`.
- **`provider_book_appointment` now block-aware**: rejects (`coach_unavailable`) if the time falls in a block, compared
  in the **facility timezone** (`providers.timezone`, via `AT TIME ZONE`). Recurring matches weekday, date matches the date;
  whole-day blocks reject any time that day. Live-tested: day-off rejected, free day booked. (Coach overlap guard unchanged.)
- UI (`ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js` **v2**): Availability tab now per-coach cards showing **Available hours**
  (Day start–end) + **Blocked/unavailable** chips; modals: **Add hours** (coach/day/start/end/service/default len) and
  **Add block / day off** (coach, one-off date OR weekly, whole-day toggle or from/to, reason). Header has both buttons.
- DEPLOY: `ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js` (v2) + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (buttons + cache-bust v2).

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — Calendar shows OPEN SLOTS + coach filter (appointments) — UI deploy
`ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js` **v3** (cache-bust appointments?v=3):
- Calendar now renders **open availability slots** per day under each day's appointments. From each trainer's
  availability window (start–end, client-side in browser-local), it generates slots of the window's default session
  length, **hides ones already booked or inside a block**, and shows the rest as dashed "tap to book" chips
  (`apBookFromSlot` → opens the booking modal **prefilled** with coach + service + date/time + duration).
- `apBookModal(prefill)` refactored to accept `{start, staff_id, service_id, duration}` (prefilled selects;
  `_apServiceCoachOpts` narrows coach list to the service's linked coaches). Header "Book appointment" still opens blank.
- **Coach filter** on the calendar header: "All coaches" + each coach (`_apCalCoach`, `apCalCoachChange`) — filters both
  appointments and open slots to one trainer's schedule.
- Calendar iterates all 7 days of the week (shows a day if it has appts OR open slots). DEPLOY: loader v3 + dashboard (cache-bust v3).

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — Appointments calendar: Day/Week/Month time-grid — UI deploy
`ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js` **v4** (cache-bust appointments?v=4):
- Calendar rebuilt as a **time-grid** (time-of-day down Y, days across X). View toggle **Day / Week / Month**,
  default **Week** containing today; `_apAnchor` is the single source of truth, prev/next/Today shift by day/week/month.
  Today's column/cell highlighted. Coach filter retained (All coaches / one coach), filters appts + open slots.
- Week/Day: vertical hour grid; hour range auto-derived from that view's appts + availability (fallback 7:00–20:00,
  min 6h). Appointments render as positioned blocks colored by status, **lane-packed** so overlaps sit side-by-side;
  **open availability slots** render as dashed "＋time" blocks (tap → prefilled booking). Clicking an appointment block
  opens **`apApptDetail`** (info + status/payment chips + the actions: check-in / mark done / confirm / reschedule /
  no-show / cancel — each closes the modal then runs).
- Month: 6×7 grid, each day shows up to 3 appt chips + "+N more"; click a day → Day view (`apOpenDay`).
- Helpers: `_apViewDays`, `_apRangeBounds`, `_apRenderGrid`, `_apRenderMonth`, `_apLanePack`, `_apGridBlock`, `_apBlockColor`.
- DEPLOY: loader **v4** + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (cache-bust v4). No backend change.

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — Day view = coach columns + 30-min grid + click-to-book + one-off availability
- DB: `provider_trainer_slots` gained **`slot_date`** (one-off availability). `provider_save_trainer_slot` accepts
  either `day_of_week` (recurring weekly) OR `slot_date` (one-off; day_of_week derived); list returns slot_date. Live-tested.
- Loader **v5** (cache-bust appointments?v=5):
  - **Day view rebuilt**: a **column per coach** (name header), **time down Y in 30-min rows**, the coach's availability
    windows shown as **green shading** (no per-slot chips), appointments as blocks. **Click any open space in a coach's
    column** → booking modal prefilled (coach + date + snapped 30-min time + service/duration from the covering window).
    Appointment blocks use stopPropagation so they open detail instead of booking. Coach filter narrows to one column.
  - `_apSlotOnDate`/`_apAvailForDayCoach` make recurring + one-off availability apply correctly everywhere (Day grid,
    Week open-slots, hour-range). Week/Month unchanged otherwise.
  - **Availability modal**: new **Repeats** selector = "Every week" (Day picker) or "One-off date" (Date picker). Availability
    list labels one-offs as "<date> (one-off)" vs "Every <Day>".
- DEPLOY: loader **v5** + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (cache-bust v5). Backend (slot_date) already live.

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — Appointments calendar: FACILITY-timezone render + Day default + fixed coach columns
Bug: a Forge Fitness (Asia/Dubai) appointment booked at 10:00 didn't appear — it was being rendered in the **viewer's**
browser timezone, so it shifted hours/day off the visible view. Fix in `ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js` **v6**:
- New `_apFacilityTz()` / `_apLocalParts(iso)` (uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with the facility tz from `FFP_PROVIDER.timezone`)
  / `_apFacilityToday()`. **Every** calendar day-bucket + time position now derives from facility-local parts
  (Day grid, Week grid, Month, open-slot booked-check, appt cards, detail modal, reschedule prefill, "today" highlight).
  Verified: 06:00Z & 07:30Z → Dubai 10:00 & 11:30 on the 17th. (Booking still saves via FFPTime.toUTC, unchanged.)
- **Default view = Day** (was Week). `_apAnchor`/Today use facility today.
- **Fixed coach column width** in Day view: `repeat(N,150px)` (was minmax(120px,1fr)) — Excel-style fixed columns, horizontal scroll.
- DEPLOY: loader **v6** + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (cache-bust v6). No backend change.

## LATEST 2026-06-17 — Appointments: fix "booked appt not showing" + separate Date/Time + dark pickers (v7)
Root cause of the appt not appearing: `provider_list_appointments` was fetched over a window computed in the **viewer's**
tz, but appts are bucketed in **facility** tz — so a Dubai 10:00 (06:00Z) appt fell outside the queried window for
western viewers and was never loaded. (Traced: viewer UTC-7 fetched 1/2; with the fix all tz fetch 2/2.)
- **`_apRangeBounds` now pads ±1 day** so the facility-local day's appts are always within the fetched UTC window.
- Booking already re-fetches+re-renders on save (real-time show); with the wider window the new appt now appears immediately.
- **Book form: separate Date + Time fields** (`ap-bk-date` type=date, `ap-bk-time` type=time step 5min) instead of one
  datetime-local — quicker; combined to `date+'T'+time` → FFPTime.toUTC on save. Slot-click prefill splits start on 'T'.
- **Platform standard**: inject `input.input[type=date|time|datetime-local]{color-scheme:dark}` once (`_apInjectStyle`)
  so all appointment pickers match the dark theme (was missing → light native pickers).
- DEPLOY: loader **v7** + `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (cache-bust v7). No backend change.
**MONEY MODEL (to freeze in Phase 2, per session, at facility confirmation):** base = per-session value (single = service
price; package = price_paid / sessions_total). `tax_aed = base * tax_rate/100`; commission = `percent` → `base*value/100`
else flat `value`; **facility net = base − tax − commission**. Revenue recognised **per completed session**.
**Completion flow:** scheduled → checked_in → trainer-marks-delivered (completed_pending) → **facility confirms** (completed,
unlocks payout). Phases left: 2 booking engine + client packages, 3 partner Appointments panel, 4 reports, 5 admin sessions-remaining.

## LATEST 2026-06-16 — Timetable tap → session roster + add member
Tapping a session on the Sessions → Timetable now opens **who's booked into that date**, not just coach/capacity.
- **`provider_session_roster(provider, occurrence)`** — booked members (status≠cancelled) with payment chip
  (Credit / Paid / Comp / Unpaid, derived from `bookings.notes` + `payment_status`) and membership chip
  (active / expired / none + credits_remaining, bridged via `provider_members`→`provider_member_plans` by email).
- **Add member:** `provider_searchable_members(provider, q)` lists platform members linked to the facility
  (via `provider_members` email bridge OR a prior booking) → `provider_session_add_member(provider, occurrence,
  member, pay_with)` with `pay_with` = `credit` (decrements a plan credit; errors if none) | `cash`/`paid`
  (marks paid, e.g. at the desk) | `comp` (free). Enforces capacity + blocks duplicate active bookings.
  `booking_source='partner'`, note records the method.
- **Remove:** `provider_session_remove_member(provider, booking)` cancels the booking and **refunds a credit**
  if it was credit-paid. Coach/capacity/cancel kept under "Session settings". UI: scheduling-loader **v12** (cache-bust v16).
- Live-tested add(comp)→roster→dup-guard(already_booked)→remove on a real occurrence; test rows cleaned up.

## SESSION STATE 2026-06-16 — Create-Listing excellence + Event ticketing + gallery/full-screen
**Partner "Create Listing" is now world-class across all four flows** (Sessions, Events, Trips, Experiences):
- **Consistent editor:** 2-step wizard (Experiences = full schedule), shared activity/country/city pickers,
  currency-aware pricing, **multi-image gallery** (cover badge, reorder, remove), and **full-screen modal**.
  Functional **map pin** (paste Google Maps link → `/api/geo/resolve` → `meeting_lat/lng`) on Events, Trips,
  Experiences. **Sessions have no own location** — they run at the facility venue (pin on Profile); by design.
- **Experiences (`classes`) = recurring schedule:** partner sets weekday(s) + daily times + capacity + end date
  (capped **+1 year**); `provider_generate_class_sessions(...)` makes the bookable `class_sessions`
  (status `scheduled`). Per-departure manage: cancel/reopen (`provider_set_class_session_status`), "close a day",
  delete. Idempotent. Replaces the old hand-typed dates.
- **Events = multi-tier ticketing:** `event_tickets` (name, price, own allocation, max/order, sales_end) +
  `event_tickets_public` (with `remaining`) + `book_event_order(member,event,[{ticket_id,qty}])` (free+paid mix in
  one order, enforces allocation/cap/window, one `bookings` row `item_type='event'`, breakdown in `notes`).
  Editor has a **Tickets** section; no-tier events keep the single `price_aed` + `rsvp_event`. Live-tested.
- **Shared `assets/ffp-gallery.js`** (`window.FFPGallery`); `gallery` jsonb added to `events`, `experiences`,
  `classes`, `session_templates` and threaded through `provider_save_listing` + `provider_save_session_template`.
- **Nav/UX:** Experiences moved to top of Engagement; create order = Experience, Session, Event, Trip, Challenge
  ("Tour"→"Experience", "Class"→"Session"). **Quests hidden** on member Passport + "Soon"/disabled on partner.
- **Booking contract** (`FFP-BOOKINGS.md`) updated: galleries (all types), event tickets, Experiences
  schedule/`status='cancelled'`.
- **Deploy queue (Grant commits):** `assets/ffp-gallery.js` (NEW), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`,
  `ffp-provider-events-loader.js` v15, `ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js` v12,
  `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` v14, `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` v14, `ffp-member-dashboard.html`.
  All DB migrations already applied live.

## 📖 LISTING MODEL (locked 2026-06-12, Grant) — partner-facing tabs → tables. ONE definition for both apps.
Class and Tour are DIFFERENT things and are SEPARATE on the partner platform (Grant: lumping them confused
partners). The split:

Each partner tab is its OWN thing with its OWN table — NO crossover, NO subtype. (Grant, locked 2026-06-12.)

| Partner tab | What it is | Table(s) | Bookable via |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tours** | one-off activity: jet ski hire, bungy jump, canyoning, guided tour/cruise | `classes` (+ `class_sessions` for the date) | `create_booking('class_session')`. NEW tours submit as **'pending' → admin approves** (admin "Tours" tab) → 'live'. No partner self-publish. |
| **Sessions** | recurring Classes: yoga, tennis lesson, group fitness (timetable + weekly + attendance) | `provider_sessions` | ⚠️ NOT yet wired in `create_booking` — booking team must wire it |
| **Trips** | retreats, camps, multi-day / sport-event trips | `experiences` | `create_booking('experience')` |
| **Events** | single-date community event members RSVP to | `events` | `create_booking('event')` |
| **Challenges** | provider challenge with results | `challenges` | n/a |

Create chooser: **Tour → Tours tab** (`openCreateClass()`→`openClassModal`), **Class → Sessions tab**
(`openCreateSession()`→`openSessionModal`), plus Trip, Event, Challenge. The booking platform reads each table and
displays it in its own section (Tours section ← `classes`; Sessions section ← `provider_sessions`).
❌ `classes.listing_subtype` and `provider_set_class_subtype` were REMOVED 2026-06-12 — they were a confusing
crossover. Tours = the whole `classes` table; Sessions = the whole `provider_sessions` table. Separate, period.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-21 — Session photo)
The Create Session form now has a **photo** (shared `renderListingUploader` → new `provider_sessions.hero_image_url`;
`provider_save_session` persists it across all rows of a weekly series). Shows as a thumbnail on the session card.
Verified live (photo saved, rolled back). DEPLOY (Netlify): `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` (v7),
`ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v62, cache-bust scheduling?v=7). DB: provider_sessions.hero_image_url + RPC.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-20 — FEATURED LISTINGS: apply → admin approve → homepage ($99/mo))
Partners can apply to feature a **Session / Tour / Event / Trip** on the FFP homepage; **$99/mo each**, billed
MANUALLY for now (Stripe wired later when Connect clears). DB: `feature_requests` table (item_type session|class|
experience|event, status pending/approved/declined, monthly_fee 99 USD, unique per item) + `provider_sessions.featured`
column; RPCs `provider_request_feature` / `provider_feature_requests` / `admin_list_feature_requests` /
`admin_decide_feature` (is_admin-gated; approve flips the listing's `featured` flag). All 4 listing tables now have
`featured`. **Partner UI:** shared helper in `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v61) — `featureBtn`/`applyFeature`/
`loadFeatureMap` → a "Feature — $99/mo" button on every Tour (classes-loader v8), Session (scheduling-loader v6),
Event + Trip card (dashboard renderEvents/renderExperiences); shows "Feature pending" then "★ Featured". **Admin:**
new `ffp-admin-featured-loader.js` + a "Featured" review queue in the admin dashboard (nav/panel/maps/global) →
Approve (sets featured=true → homepage shows it) / Decline. Verified live: apply=ok, request pending, admin queue
lists it (rolled back). **DEPLOY (Netlify):** `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` (v8), `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js`
(v6), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v61), `ffp-admin-featured-loader.js` (NEW — commit or 404), `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`.
DB applied. ⚠️ Not browser-tested — Grant to confirm: Feature button → admin Featured queue → Approve → ★ + homepage.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-23 — SESSIONS REBUILD: partner UI built (class + weekly schedule + per-occurrence))
Built the partner UI on the LATEST-22 engine (`ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` v8, `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`
v63). **"New class"** opens the class-template form: class details + **Session description** + photo + Fitness level
(attendeeLevels) + **Weekly schedule rows** (Day + Time + Coach-from-staff, add/remove) → `provider_save_session_template`
(generates 12wk of occurrences). Sessions list = **one card per class** (shows its weekly schedule). **Timetable**
shows the weekly pattern (dedup by slot_id); tapping a slot opens **Manage session** for that single occurrence →
substitute coach / change capacity / **cancel that date** (provider_save_session + provider_cancel_session) without
touching the rest. Attendance + coach-bio preserved. `openCreateSession` (create chooser "Class") → `openTemplateModal`.
VERIFIED LIVE (rolled back): template→24 occurrences w/ per-slot coach; per-occurrence coach Lee→Mia + cap 8 + cancel,
other occurrences unaffected. DEPLOY (Netlify): `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` (v8), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`
(v63→v64, scheduling loader v8→v9). DB engine already applied (LATEST-22). ⚠️ Browser-test: New class → add weekly
times+coaches → Save → Timetable shows them → tap a slot → substitute/cancel.
FEATURE re-pointed (done): featuring a "session" now targets **`session_templates.featured`** (the class), not an
occurrence — `provider_request_feature`/`admin_decide_feature`/`admin_list_feature_requests` updated; Feature button
back on the class card; `provider_list_session_templates` returns `featured`. Verified live (apply=ok, admin queue
shows the class). The booking platform should read `session_templates.featured` for featured classes.

LATEST-24 (2026-06-12) — SESSIONS NOT SHOWING + TZ FIX. Bug: sessions created with the OLD create-session form
inserted straight into `provider_sessions` with `template_id=NULL`, so the rebuilt Sessions tab (lists
`session_templates`) showed "No classes yet". Found 10 orphans (Find Fit People "Beach Workout" ×8, Viking Surf
"Surf Sports" ×2). ALSO found a timezone bug: generation cast the naive slot string to timestamptz in the DB session
tz (UTC), so slot_time was stored/shown as UTC (06:00 Dubai displayed as 02:00). Fix (DB only, no loader change):
(1) `providers.timezone` column default 'Asia/Dubai'; (2) `provider_save_session_template` regen now builds occurrences
`((date||' '||slot_time)::timestamp AT TIME ZONE provider.timezone)` and uses `now() AT TIME ZONE tz` for the base
date — slot_time is now treated as FACILITY-LOCAL time; (3) backfill migration `backfill_orphan_sessions_to_templates`
created one template per (provider,title,activity), one weekly slot per distinct (local dow, local time, coach), and
linked all orphan occurrences. Verified: Find Fit People now lists Beach Workout with a Sat 06:00 (Grant Goes) slot;
0 orphans. NOTE for booking platform: facility timezone lives in `providers.timezone`; `provider_sessions.start_at`
is the absolute instant (render in local tz). Pending refinement: per-occurrence edit (`provider_save_session`) and a
provider-timezone picker in Profile (currently defaults Dubai).

LATEST-25 (2026-06-12) — FACILITY TIMEZONE, ALL LISTING TYPES. Grant: "Do the time zone picker... sorted out for
all things, trips, events, tours, sessions." Built: (1) `providers.timezone` (default Asia/Dubai, existing 4 rows
backfilled); exposed app-wide via `window.FFP_PROVIDER.timezone` (ffp-provider-auth.js, +select). (2) NEW shared
helper **assets/ffp-time.js** (`window.FFPTime`): `toUTC/toInput/toDateInput/toTimeInput/fmt/addMinutes/list` —
library-free, DST-correct via Intl offset (unit-tested: Dubai, NY/EST, London/BST all pass). Eager-loaded in
dashboard (?v=1). (3) Profile gets a **Timezone picker** — searchable IANA list; `wrapSelectAsPicker` enhanced with
a search box when options>12; loads/validates/saves `providers.timezone` via `provider_save_profile` (RPC +timezone),
updates FFP_PROVIDER on save. (4) Capture+prefill routed through FFPTime so partners enter wall-clock in THEIR
facility tz, stored UTC: Tours (classes-loader cm-sess-dt), Events (buildStartsAt + mapForUi split), Trips
(experiences start/end date = local midnight). Sessions already tz-aware server-side (LATEST-24). Versions: dashboard
v65, auth?v=6, profile?v=15, classes?v=9, events?v=11, experiences?v=8, ffp-time?v=1. Live-tested: provider_save_profile
persists timezone. NOTE booking platform: `providers.timezone` is the facility zone; all `*.starts_at/start_at` are
absolute UTC instants — render in facility tz. Minor follow-up: card-list DISPLAYS still use browser-local
toLocaleString (fine when partner=facility tz); could switch to FFPTime.fmt for multi-tz staff.

LATEST-26 (2026-06-13) — PROFESSIONAL SERVICES + service-based timetable. Grant: pros offer a SERVICE (PT session /
assessment / 12-week program), set a timetable (slots) per service, add clients or let clients book online; "these
are just the service type — user buys a service then books sessions via credits"; pricing "both, pro decides per
service". Scope locked: build PRO DASHBOARD side now + write client-booking contract (booking team builds client UI).
Built: (1) DB **pro_services** (name, service_type, duration_min, capacity, pricing_mode credit|pay_per_session,
price_aed, credits_granted, validity_days, location, status); `pro_slots.service_id` + `pro_client_packages.service_id`;
backfill of legacy orphan slots (no-op — 0 existed). RPCs: pro_list_services / pro_save_service / pro_delete_service;
pro_save_slot now takes service_id and INHERITS duration/capacity/slot_type from the service; pro_list_slots +
pro_week_schedule carry service_id/service_name. (2) NEW **ffp-professional-services-loader.js** (renderServices +
service modal with pricing-mode toggle showing credits-granted/validity only for credit mode; archive). (3) Dashboard:
new **Services** nav + #panel-services, _provLoaderSrc + renderPanel wired, PRO_BUILD 7→8. (4) Scheduling loader: slot
modal now requires a **Service** picker (gates with "add a service first" if none), autofills duration/capacity from
the service; occCard shows service name; copy updated (availability per service, client can book online). Live-tested
end-to-end (service→slot inherit→lists), rolled back; JS validated (services FULL clean; scheduling truncation-false-
positive confirmed intact). Client-facing booking = **FFP-PRO-BOOKING-CONTRACT.md** (buy-service credits / pay-per-
session via Stripe Connect Standard on the pro's account; pro_buy_service / pro_book_slot / pro_mark_booking_paid to be
built; flagged gaps: professionals has no stripe_account_id or timezone yet). Files to deploy: ffp-professional-services-
loader.js (NEW — must be committed), ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js, ffp-professional-dashboard.html.

LATEST-27 (2026-06-13) — PRO booking decisions LOCKED + parity columns. Grant locked all 5 pro-booking decisions:
(1) bookings stored in shared `bookings` table, `item_type='pro_slot'` (constraint updated when wired); (2/3) ADDED
`professionals.stripe_account_id`, `stripe_connected_at`, `payments_status`, `timezone` (default Asia/Dubai) —
mirroring providers; FFP_PROVIDER on the pro dashboard now exposes `timezone` (line 775) so shared FFPTime works for
pros identically to facilities; (4) out-of-credits → client may pay-per-session OR re-buy the package (full price, not
a discount site) — same as facilities; (5) capacity>1 fills remaining spots online. Contract FFP-PRO-BOOKING-CONTRACT.md
§4/§6/§8 updated to reflect. Remaining Passport build (when booking team ready): pro_buy_service / pro_book_slot /
pro_mark_booking_paid (atomic credit+capacity) + add 'pro_slot' to bookings item_type constraint. Small follow-up: a
timezone picker in the pro Profile UI (pros default Asia/Dubai until then).

LATEST-28 (2026-06-13) — CORRECTED Services/Packages model + DEPLOYMENT GAP found. Grant clarified: "you buy a
session OR a package for a particular service — there is a difference." So a SERVICE = the offering + a per-session
price (single booking); a PACKAGE = a multi-session bundle FOR a service (credits). Refactored: dropped
pro_services.pricing_mode/credits_granted/validity_days (price_aed now = per-session price); added
pro_packages.service_id; pro_save_service/pro_list_services simplified; pro_save_package/pro_list_packages carry
service_id+service_name. UI: services modal now just per-session price (+ note pointing to Packages for bundles);
service card shows "AED x / session" + package_count; the Packages modal (client loader) gained a "For which service"
picker; package rows show the service. PRO_BUILD 8→9. Live-tested (service per-session 250 + 10-pack tied to service),
rolled back; JS clean. ⚠️ DEPLOYMENT GAP (Grant: "nothing different… is it live?"): the workspace folder is NOT the
git repo and NOT auto-deployed — ffppassport.com (Netlify, site e3da76a4-…) still serves the OLD professional
dashboard (verified via fetch). NOTHING in LATEST-26/27/28 is live until these files are deployed to the repo/Netlify.
PROTOCOL going forward: after any change, state clearly it is not live until deployed, and verify the live URL after
deploy. Files to deploy (complete pro-services set): ffp-professional-dashboard.html, ffp-professional-services-loader.js
(NEW), ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js, ffp-professional-client-loader.js. DEPLOY VERIFIED LIVE (fetched
ffppassport.com — Services panel + new Scheduling/Packages copy present).

LATEST-29 (2026-06-13) — PARTNER PORTAL Sessions/Timetable rework (professionals parked). Grant: Timetable needs an
"Add session" (choose class, allocate day/time); attendance shown on the timetable thumb as 3/12 (attending/capacity);
check-in belongs in the Check-ins panel, not the Attendance tab. Built: (DB) provider_add_template_slot (adds one
weekly slot to a class template + generates 12 wks tz-aware) and provider_add_oneoff_session (single dated occurrence);
both live-tested (12 occ / one-off once), rolled back. (UI, scheduling loader v9→v10, cache-bust scheduling?v=10):
Timetable "Add session" button → openAddSession modal (pick class → weekly-recurring OR one-off date [FFPTime tz] +
optional coach); each timetable thumb shows a present/capacity badge from provider_attendance_counts; the
Scheduling→Attendance tab REMOVED from the dashboard (renderAttendance fns left dormant). Files: ffp-provider-
scheduling-loader.js, ffp-provider-dashboard.html (NOT yet deployed — must push + verify live).
PENDING (task 45) — Check-ins panel rework: Grant wants member scans QR OR staff enters member number to check into a
session. DECISION NEEDED: "member number" = platform members.access_code/passport_no (the FFP Passport identifier
their QR encodes), but provider_attendance.member_id currently references provider_members (facility-local list). So
check-in must map a platform member (by access_code) → find/create provider_members link → record attendance.
Confirm identity model before building.
RESOLVED + BUILT (LATEST-30).

LATEST-30 (2026-06-13) — CHECK-INS session check-in (code-first + fallback). Grant chose "both — code first, fallback
to list." Built: (DB) provider_checkin_session(provider, session, p{code|provider_member_id}) — code matches
members.access_code OR passport_no, auto-creates/links a provider_members row, upserts provider_attendance='present';
provider_today_sessions(provider) lists ~today's occurrences with present counts. Both live-tested (code path created
+ checked in real member "Vanshita…"; local path upsert), rolled back. (UI) Check-ins panel gains a "Check in to a
session" card (session selector + member-code input + Scan QR + My members picker + live roster). Loader
ffp-provider-checkins-loader.js v2→v3 (cache-bust checkins?v=3). NOTE: access_code is a long token (QR-friendly);
typed entry uses passport_no — both matched by the RPC. PARTNER deploy set (all DB already live): ffp-provider-
scheduling-loader.js (v10), ffp-provider-checkins-loader.js (v3), ffp-provider-dashboard.html. Not yet deployed —
push + verify live. DEPLOYED + verified live (session check-in card visible on ffppassport.com).
FOLLOW-UP (2026-06-13): removed the "Enter member claim code" (deal-redemption) card from the Check-ins panel —
Grant: redundant-looking + Deals is SOON; redemption to be designed cleanly when Deals launches. Kept the session
check-in card + "Recent check-ins" list. checkins-loader's verifyClaimCode override now a harmless no-op (no input).
Redeploy ffp-provider-dashboard.html.

LATEST-31 (2026-06-13) — POLISH + UX audit + FEATURED per-day + reviews finding. (a) UX AUDIT (FFP-UX-AUDIT-
Sessions.md): biggest gap = member booking journey not in the Passport (intentional — stays on findfitpeople.com per
Grant). (b) POLISH: NEW shared dark-select **assets/ffp-select.js** (FFPSelect.enhance) — Sessions dropdowns
(level/day/coach/add-session/occurrence) now match Profile's picker; timetable shows facility timezone + flags
one-off sessions; orphaned "Recent check-ins" hidden. scheduling loader v11, +ffp-select?v=1. (c) REVIEWS finding:
reviews are facility/venue-level (triggered by member venue self-check-in via activity_logs), NOT session/coach-level,
and NOT linked to the new session attendance. Grant: make reviews SESSION-level → task #51 (next, not yet built).
(d) FEATURED redesigned to **$99 USD/DAY** (Grant): partner requests specific days (range or multi-select), admin
confirms, partner pays upfront, admin sets live; live only on paid days. DB: feature_days table + feature_requests
(day_rate_usd, total_usd, statuses pending/approved/live/declined; dropped unique(item,type); status check widened to
include 'live'). RPCs: provider_request_feature_days, provider_feature_requests (+days), admin_list_feature_requests
(+days/total), admin_decide_feature (approve|live|decline), is_featured_today(kind,id,day). Partner UI: day-picker
modal (range+multi) w/ live $99×days total; featureBtn shows pending/approved/live. Admin queue (ffp-admin-featured-
loader v2, ?v=2): days+total+status, Approve→Set live lifecycle. PAYMENT deferred (manual for now — admin contacts
partner, partner pays, admin Set live). Homepage must read is_featured_today/feature_days (FFP-BOOKING-CONTRACT §6
updated). Live-tested per-day lifecycle (request→live→is_featured_today true on day, false off-day), rolled back; JS
clean. DEPLOY SET: assets/ffp-select.js (NEW), ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js (v11), ffp-provider-dashboard.html
(v66), ffp-admin-featured-loader.js (v2), ffp-admin-dashboard.html (cache-bust). DB already live.

LATEST-32 (2026-06-13) — SESSION-LEVEL REVIEWS (build started). Grant's mechanism: member scans partner/pro QR →
options (what's on now) show → member picks the session they're doing → that becomes the reviewed session. FOUNDATION
built + live-tested (rolled back): (DB) activity_logs += session_id, coach; provider_reviews += session_id,
session_title, coach. RPCs: member_provider_options(provider) → today's session occurrences (now-3h..now+18h);
venue_checkin_session(me,provider,session,lat,lng) → session-linked activity_log (category 'Session') + mirrors into
provider_attendance (find/create provider_members link) so the timetable badge reflects member self-check-ins +
2h venue cooldown + geo-verify; provider_reviews_list now returns session_title + coach. Verified: options=1,
checkin ok w/ coach, review row shows "Beach Workout · Grant Goes". REMAINING PHASES (frontend, not yet built):
(1) Member dashboard — after QR scan show member_provider_options as choices → venue_checkin_session on pick;
(2) review modal session-aware (prompt names the session+coach, save provider_reviews with session_id/title/coach);
(3) partner Overview — show per-session/per-coach review context (provider_reviews_list already returns it);
(4) professional mirror (pro QR → pro services/slots) — later. No frontend files changed yet this step.

LATEST-33 (2026-06-13) — CONTEXTUAL REVIEWS foundation (Grant: "review depends on what they're doing" + comment AND
photo). Verified against LIVE code (member_pending_reviews/submit_provider_review read from DB; booking_checkin tags
activity_logs.category=initcap(item_type) → 'Experience'/'Event', venue_checkin_session sets category 'Session'+
session_id). Approved review dimensions (Overall headline + 3 specifics): SESSION = Coach·Value·Atmosphere;
EVENT = Organisation·Value·Atmosphere; TRIP/Experience = Guide/host·Value·Organisation&logistics; VENUE visit = keep
existing Experience·Service·Facilities. DB built+tested (rolled back): provider_reviews += review_kind, ratings jsonb,
photo_url (session_id/title/coach already added). member_pending_reviews now returns review_kind (session|trip|event|
venue, server-computed) + session_id/coach/category. submit_provider_review replaced (dropped old 8-arg) → accepts
p_kind, p_ratings jsonb, p_photo; pulls session_id/coach/title from the log; venue still uses the 4 category columns
so provider_rating averages don't break. provider_reviews_list returns review_kind/ratings/photo_url/session_title/
coach. Verified: pending kind='session', review stored "Beach Workout · Grant Goes" + sub-ratings + photo.
REMAINING (frontend, not built): (1) member review modal branches on review_kind → per-type star dimensions + comment
+ optional PHOTO upload (FFPUpload, quest-images), passes kind+ratings+photo to submit; (2) member scan sheet adds the
"On now — classes" session section (member_provider_options → venue_checkin_session) per the approved mockup;
(3) partner Overview shows per-type sub-ratings + coach + photo. DB only this step.

LATEST-34 (2026-06-13) — CONTEXTUAL REVIEWS frontend (all 3 phases built, world-class). (1) MEMBER review modal
(ffp-member-dashboard.html): rv-cats now rendered dynamically per review_kind via DIMS map (session=Coach/Value/
Atmosphere, event=Organisation/Value/Atmosphere, trip=Guide/Value/Logistics, venue=Experience/Service/Facilities);
header shows session+coach; added optional PHOTO (FFPUpload.pick → activity-photos bucket); submit branches — venue
passes the 4 columns, others pass p_kind + p_ratings jsonb + p_photo. (2) MEMBER scan sheet (ffp-member-checkin-
loader.js v8→v9, ?v=9): new "On now — classes" section (member_provider_options) between bookings and the Quest/Event/
Challenge row; tap → venue_checkin_session → session-linked log (+mirrors attendance) → resultMsg. (3) PARTNER Overview
(provider dashboard v67): each review row shows session·coach context, sub-rating chips (PR_RLBL labels), and the
review photo. JS validated (member checkin loader structure intact via Read; mount-truncation false positive at the
serve boundary, established pattern). NOT yet browser-tested/deployed. DEPLOY SET: ffp-member-dashboard.html,
ffp-member-checkin-loader.js (v9), ffp-provider-dashboard.html (v67). DB already live. Pending: pro mirror (pro QR →
services) later; browser test + deploy + verify live.

LATEST-35 (2026-06-13) — PROFESSIONAL REVIEW MIRROR (built + live-tested). Finding: pros had ZERO check-in/review
infra; not venues (no geo). Reused the ONE review engine. Grant locks: member scans pro QR OR pro checks member in;
member's QR = Passport access_code (created at purchase); review 90 min after check-in; pro dims = Overall·
Communication·Environment·Value. DB (live-tested, rolled back): activity_logs/provider_reviews += professional_id
(provider_id now nullable); member_pro_options(pro) → active services; pro_checkin_service(me,pro,service) (member
self-scan, no geo, 2h cooldown); pro_checkin_member(pro,service,code) (pro scans member Passport code → resolves
members.access_code/passport_no); member_pending_reviews surfaces pro logs after 90 min w/ kind='pro' + pro name/photo;
submit_provider_review accepts p_professional; pro_rating + pro_reviews_list. Verified: self check-in + pro check-in +
pending kind='pro' + rating avgs + review row. FRONTEND: member modal DIMS.pro + submit routes to p_professional;
member check-in loader v9→v10 (?v=10) handles ?pro= scan → services → pro_checkin_service (parsePro/openProContext/
proServiceCheckin + boot/pending-pro resume); professional dashboard — new **Check-in** nav+panel (service select +
member-code → pro_checkin_member) and Overview **"Your rating"** (pro_rating + pro_reviews_list w/ sub-ratings+photo).
JS: checkin loader clean (trunc false-positive); pro dashboard inline block balanced (mount-truncation blocks bash
node-check past the boundary — trusted Edit). DEPLOY SET: ffp-member-dashboard.html, ffp-member-checkin-loader.js (v10),
ffp-professional-dashboard.html. DB already live. NOTE: pro needs a QR to display (encodes ?pro=<id>) for the member-
scan path — "Show my QR" on the pro dashboard is a small follow-up. NEXT: Tours/Experiences/Events/Trips polish — NEEDS
naming decision first (Grant flagged Tours→"Experiences" but Trips already = experiences table; confirm exact labels).

LATEST-36 (2026-06-13) — RENAME Tours → "Experiences" (label-only; Trips unchanged). Grant: user sees "Experiences"
instead of "Tours"; keep "Trips". UNDERLYING UNCHANGED: classes table, panel ids (panel-classes/panel-tours),
item_type='class', nav id 'classes', RPC kinds, realtime channels, AdminTours var, console logs. Changed user-facing
labels only: provider dashboard (nav label, panel header, "New experience" button, help-strip, sessions psub
reference); admin dashboard (nav, h1, panel title map); ffp-provider-classes-loader.js (empty states, modal title
New/Edit experience, toasts, delete confirm, distance hint); ffp-admin-classes-loader.js (empty/approve/reject/preview
strings). Cache-busts: provider classes?v=10, admin classes?v=2. Both loaders validated (truncation false-positives
only). DEPLOY: ffp-provider-dashboard.html, ffp-admin-dashboard.html, ffp-provider-classes-loader.js (v10),
ffp-admin-classes-loader.js (v2). NEXT (still pending, Grant's "polish full flow"): apply shared FFPSelect dark picker
+ timezone labels + field-standard consistency to the Experiences / Events / Trips create-edit forms (like Sessions).

LATEST-37 (2026-06-13) — VERIFY-LIVE caught 2 naming clashes from the rename; fixed. (a) Live fetch confirmed the
partner portal shows "Experiences" + "New experience" ✓. (b) BUT: admin already labelled the `experiences` TABLE
"Experiences" (its Trips equivalent — has "FFP-Organized Trip"), so the admin Tours→Experiences rename created a
DUPLICATE "Experiences" in admin. FIX: aligned admin vocabulary to the partner portal — `experiences` table panel
(panel-experiences) renamed "Experiences"→"Trips" (nav flight_takeoff, h1, title map, search placeholder); the
`classes` panel (panel-tours) stays "Experiences". Net per the partner portal: Experiences = classes, Trips =
experiences table, everywhere. (c) Also fixed the partner Trips panel help-strip that read "New experiences are
reviewed…" → "New trips…". Redeploy: ffp-provider-dashboard.html, ffp-admin-dashboard.html.

LATEST-38 (2026-06-13) — Admin rename VERIFIED LIVE (screenshot: sidebar shows Trips + Experiences separately;
Experiences panel lists the rafting experience = classes table). Earlier stale fetches were CDN cache. Deploy note:
ffppassport.com = Netlify site e3da76a4 building from github.com/grant2223/ffp-passport main (Grant commits the files
shared via cards). Big files (admin dashboard 171KB) should be committed via GitHub "Upload files" not paste (a paste
once shipped an OLD copy → Netlify "all files already uploaded"). ADMIN v47→v48: sidebar section headers (Mission
Control/Approvals/Marketplace/Platform) enlarged 9px→11px + brighter (var(--text)) + COLLAPSIBLE — click a header to
toggle its links (JS walks siblings to the next header; chevron rotates; collapse state saved per-section in
localStorage). CSS .sidebar-section-label + .sec-caret + .sidebar-link.sec-hidden; inline setup() IIFE after the nav.
footer build v47→v48. Redeploy ffp-admin-dashboard.html (use Upload files for the 171KB file).

LATEST-39 (2026-06-13) — Form-consistency polish + Bookings update. POLISH: Experiences/Events/Trips create-edit
modals now enhance their native `.select`s to the shared dark picker (FFPSelect.enhance on #modal / .modal after open) —
matches Sessions/Profile; country/city stay FFPPicker buttons (untouched). Trips modal title corrected "experience"→
"trip". Cache-busts: classes?v=11, events?v=12, experiences?v=9. JS validated (truncation false-positives only).
BOOKINGS UPDATE: wrote FFP-BOOKINGS-UPDATE.md for the findfitpeople team — consolidated change list + action checklist:
(1) FEATURED now per-day → read is_featured_today/feature_days not *.featured (breaking); (2) labels Tours→Experiences
(classes), experiences table→Trips (item_type unchanged); (3) reviews contextual + pro reviews (review_kind/ratings/
photo_url/professional_id; pro_rating/pro_reviews_list; 60min venue / 90min pro trigger); (4) check-in surfaces
(member_provider_options/venue_checkin_session, member_pro_options/pro_checkin_service, pro_checkin_member); (5) pros
are a new bookable surface; (6) providers/professionals.timezone; (7) Stripe Connect Standard unchanged. Companion to
the two contracts. DEPLOY (form polish): ffp-provider-classes-loader.js (v11), ffp-provider-events-loader.js (v12),
ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js (v9), ffp-provider-dashboard.html.

LATEST-40 (2026-06-13) — Pro QR (completes the member-scan loop) + timezone hints. (a) PRO "Your check-in QR" on the
professional Check-in page: renderProQR() loads qrcodejs (CDN) and renders a QR encoding
https://ffppassport.com/ffp-member-dashboard.html?pro=<professional_id> — members scan it → openProContext (member-
checkin loader v10) → services → pro_checkin_service → 90-min review. This is what makes the member-scan pro path
usable end-to-end. (b) Timezone hints: Experiences (classes) date section + Events "When" section now show "Times
shown in <facility tz>" (FFPTime.tz()); Trips are date-only so skipped. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-dashboard.html,
ffp-provider-classes-loader.js (v11), ffp-provider-dashboard.html (events hint), ffp-provider-events-loader.js (v12),
ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js (v9). Reminder: deploy big files via GitHub Upload-files at repo root, exact name.

LATEST-41 (2026-06-13) — Pro QR "Download QR (PNG)" (parity with facility venue QR): proDownloadQR() draws the
#pro-qr-box canvas/img onto a padded white canvas → downloads FFP-Pro-QR.png. Pro QR feature now complete (display +
download). Only ffp-professional-dashboard.html changed (top-level reload). NEXT MAJOR (recommended, needs go-ahead as
it's the booking-team interface): build our committed booking RPCs per the locked contracts — facility book_session
(credit auto|credit|cash) + grant_member_plan + mark_booking_paid; pro pro_buy_service + pro_book_slot +
pro_mark_booking_paid + add 'pro_slot' to bookings item_type constraint.

LATEST-42 (2026-06-13) — BOOKING RPCs BUILT + live-tested (our side of the contracts; DB-only, booking team calls
them). FACILITY: book_session(member, occurrence(provider_sessions), qty, pay_with auto|credit|cash) — credit spends
provider_member_plans.credits_remaining (1 credit=1 seat, expiry-aware, FOR UPDATE), auto-no-credits returns
needs_payment(options pay|buy_credits), cash → unpaid booking; grant_member_plan(member,provider,plan,start);
mark_booking_paid(booking,intent,charge). PRO: grant_pro_package(member,professional,package,start) →
pro_client_packages; pro_book_slot(member,slot,occurrence_date,pay_with) — occurrence datetime in pro tz, capacity =
standing pro_slot_clients + booked-that-date, credit from pro_client_packages(service); reuse mark_booking_paid.
KEY: credits are keyed to facility-local (provider_members) / pro-local (pro_clients) members; RPCs BRIDGE the
platform members.id → local by EMAIL (find/create), same as check-in; bookings.member_id = platform member.
bookings item_type: 'provider_session' (facility), 'professional_session' (pro — already allowed; provider_id null,
pro via item_id→pro_slots). Caught live: bookings_payment_status_check rejects 'credit' → credit bookings use
payment_status='paid' (status 'confirmed'); item_type/status/payment checks all respected. Both paths verified
end-to-end, rolled back. Contracts updated with final signatures (FFP-BOOKING-CONTRACT §9, FFP-PRO-BOOKING-CONTRACT).
No frontend (booking UI is findfitpeople's). NOTE: facility "assign plan" UI assigns to provider_members (local) — same
provider_member_plans the booking RPCs draw from, so credits are unified across both paths.

LATEST-65 (2026-06-14) — FROZEN HEADER audit across ALL dashboards. Findings: MEMBER = topbar position:fixed (frozen
✓); ADMIN = CSS grid, topbar is its own grid row (frozen ✓); PROFESSIONAL = structural flex (frozen ✓, done earlier);
PROVIDER = was sticky-inside-scroller (same fragile pattern that failed on the pro PWA) → FIXED structurally:
.main is now a flex column (overflow:hidden); .topbar + .ffp-save-banner are flex:0 0 auto (the frozen header — save
banner no longer position:sticky top:62px, just a flex sibling that shows/hides); existing .panel-wrap is now the
scroll area (flex:1; min-height:0; overflow-y:auto; width:100% + its max-width:1280/margin auto keeps content centred).
Scrollbar styling moved .main→.panel-wrap. CSS-only, no JS. DEPLOY: ffp-provider-dashboard.html.

LATEST-64 (2026-06-14) — PRO VIDEOS public read (booking-team blocker). pro_videos had RLS on, 0 policies → anon
read blocked. Added: RLS SELECT policy pro_videos_public_read (anon,authenticated) gated to professionals
is_published+verification_status='approved'; AND view pro_videos_public (id,professional_id,url,kind,title,sort_order,
created_at) granted to anon,authenticated. Verified live: policy present, view returns rows (1 approved pro video
visible). Live DB change, no deploy. FFP-BOOKINGS.md updated.

LATEST-63 (2026-06-14) — SLOT CARDS: name headline + availability. occCard (Schedule) + _ovSessRow (Overview, shared
by today + day lists): headline is now "TIME · <booked person's name>" (names no longer in the grey sub); when the
spot is open the headline falls back to the session type. Availability badge: cap=1 open → "Available"; group open →
"N available"; none → "Full" (green when available — the unbooked "notification" on both Schedule and Overview).
Validated 4 cases. Date header (.sched-day-h) bumped 11px→14px to match the card time. PRO_BUILD→20. DEPLOY:
ffp-professional-dashboard.html, ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js.

LATEST-62 (2026-06-14) — SCHEDULING tweaks. (1) NO OVERLAP: saveSlot now rejects a slot whose time range overlaps
an existing slot on the SAME weekday (client-side check vs _proSlotsCache; minute math; ignores self when editing;
adjacent times allowed). Validated 5 cases. (NB: client-side only — DB doesn't enforce; add a pro_save_slot guard if
ever needed.) (2) Date nav (arrows + range) is now its own FULL-WIDTH row (range flex:1 centered). (3) Day/Week/Month
seg is FULL-WIDTH (seg display:flex width:100% + seg-btn flex:1). (4) FIELD FONT PARITY: on mobile the FFPSelect
picker buttons + .phone-cc stayed 13px while native inputs were 16px → added .ffp-sel-btn,.phone-cc to the mobile 16px
rule so all New-slot fields match. (5) Capacity label hint → "spots available". PRO_BUILD→19. DEPLOY:
ffp-professional-dashboard.html, ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js.

LATEST-61 (2026-06-14) — PRO profile HEADER IMAGE upload. Added a wide header/cover uploader to the profile Photo
section (pickProCover → FFPUpload.pick bucket quest-images, aspect 16/9, outW1280/outH720 → professional_save_profile
{cover_photo_url}). DB already had cover_photo_url + the RPC accepts it + professionals_public already exposes it, so
the storefront banner populates with no DB change. HTML-only (renderProfileForm markup + pickProCover) — no PRO_BUILD
bump needed. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-dashboard.html.

LATEST-60 (2026-06-14) — PRO header (real fix) + Service/Session merge + slot tweaks. (a) HEADER: the sticky-inside-
scroller kept failing on the phone PWA (known edge case). DEFINITIVE FIX: restructured .main into a flex COLUMN
(overflow:hidden) with the topbar as a flex:0 0 auto sibling (no longer sticky) + a new .main-scroll child
(flex:1;overflow-y:auto) wrapping all panels. Header physically cannot scroll now. showPanel scroll-reset now targets
.main-scroll. Horizontal padding moved to topbar + .main-scroll. (b) TIME FIELD oversized on iOS → added
.input[type=time]/[type=date]{-webkit-appearance:none}. (c) SERVICE vs SESSION TYPE: merged — removed the Session
type field from the slot form; a slot now just picks a SERVICE (full-width) and inherits its type (pro_save_slot
already does this). The Service IS the typed offering: services-loader SERVICE_TYPES now = FFP_TAX.sessionTypes (One on
One/Group/Assessment). (d) Add-client-by-name field moved ABOVE the client list in the slot modal. OPEN/offered (not
built): a map pin-drop for slot Location (currently free text) — same /api/geo/resolve pattern as the provider
profile if wanted. PRO_BUILD→18. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-dashboard.html, ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js,
ffp-professional-services-loader.js.

LATEST-59 (2026-06-14) — NEW SLOT form cleanup. Removed the Title field (slot title defaults to service name/null in
pro_save_slot — saveSlot still sends title:'' harmlessly). Reordered the form-grid: Session type + Service (row 1),
Day + Time (row 2), Duration + Capacity (row 3, Capacity hint "spots clients can book"), Location now full-width (row
4). Fixes the misaligned time field (now a clean half-cell beside Day). MODEL (confirmed to Grant): a slot = a
recurring weekly working-time block (day+time+duration+type, optional service); capacity = total spots; trainer
assigns clients in "Who's in this slot" AND/OR leaves spots open → open spots (capacity − assigned) are bookable
online via findfitpeople; timetable shows N open / Full. PRO_BUILD→17. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-dashboard.html,
ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js.

LATEST-58 (2026-06-14) — PRO dashboard UI POLISH round 2. (a) PROFILE: removed the section boxes (platform standard
= no boxes) — sections now separated by spacing + purple title only (#panel-profile .form-section margin only). Save
button is full-width. (b) More bottom room on every page: .main padding-bottom 120px desktop / 160px mobile so the
last fields/Save clear the bottom nav comfortably. (c) SCHEDULING: "Add session" → "Add slot" (the spot is what opens
for online booking — a slot can have someone assigned or be open) and the modal is now "New slot/Edit slot"; the
button moved ABOVE the date nav and is full-width; "Today" button removed. (d) NAV reorder to Overview · Schedule ·
Check-in · Clients · Payments (PRO_NAV; Schedule label; Services moved to PRO_NAV_EXTRA/avatar); PRO_BOTTOM matches
(overview/scheduling/checkin-center/clients/payments). PRO_BUILD→16. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-dashboard.html,
ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js.

LATEST-57 (2026-06-14) — PRO dashboard UI POLISH. (a) HEADER frozen: removed .main top-padding (the gap that let
content show above the sticky topbar) — topbar now padding:16px 0 12px + border-bottom; truly sticky. (b) SAVE clears
nav: .main bottom-padding 80px desktop / 120px mobile (was hidden under bottom-nav + raised FAB). (c) PROFILE: email
+ phone now full-width (were cramped half-cells); Languages is now a DROPDOWN sourced from FFP_TAX.languages (25
langs; chosen → removable chips) replacing the chip-wall; "Add profession" is now a visible btn-sec (was a faint
chip); each profile section is a card (#panel-profile .form-section bg+border+radius) with a purple title — clear
separation. (d) SCHEDULING: Day | Week | Month toggle (added Day; day nav steps ±1 day); views always render even
when empty (removed the week full-screen empty-state replacement; day/month show empty states inline); "Add session"
is a full-width primary button below the toolbar; "Today" restyled to btn-sec (was a stray ghost pill). FFP_TAX gained
T.languages. Validated logic in isolation. PRO_BUILD→15, ffp-taxonomy.js→v11. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-dashboard.html,
ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js, assets/ffp-taxonomy.js.

LATEST-56 (2026-06-14) — PRO dashboard overhaul WAVE 2 (audit fixes: phone, taxonomy, modals). (a) PHONE: added a
shared country-code picker to the pro dashboard (_phoneOptionsHtml/_phoneField/_phoneSet/_phoneGet, generic by id
prefix; .phone-input/.phone-cc/.phone-num CSS; codes from FFP_TAX.phoneCodes) — replaces the plain tel inputs on the
Profile (pf-phone) and the Client modal (mm-phone, via window._phoneField/_phoneSet/_phoneGet). Validated set/get
(AU +61, empty→+971). (b) TAXONOMY: the loaders now source their pick-lists from FFP_TAX with a local fallback —
services SERVICE_TYPES→FFP_TAX.serviceTypes, client CLIENT_STATUS/PKG_TYPES/COMMS_CHANNELS→FFP_TAX.*, billing
PAY_METHODS→FFP_TAX.payMethods (scheduling SLOT_TYPES already on FFP_TAX.sessionTypes in Wave 1). Client modal status
select now built from CLIENT_STATUS. Dead PRO_TYPE_OPTIONS removed. (c) MODALS: included assets/ffp-select.js?v=1;
openModalShell now runs FFPSelect.enhance on the modal body (all modal selects → dark searchable picker; FFPSelect
dispatches change so service/onchange handlers keep working); profile Currency select (54 options) enhanced too.
Validated client-modal block in isolation. PRO_BUILD→14. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-dashboard.html,
ffp-professional-services-loader.js, ffp-professional-client-loader.js, ffp-professional-billing-loader.js
(assets/ffp-select.js already live; assets/ffp-taxonomy.js v10 from Wave 1). Pro forms now meet the platform standard.

LATEST-55 (2026-06-14) — PRO dashboard overhaul WAVE 1 (nav + scheduling + session types). (a) NAV: removed
Scheduling + Check-in from the avatar menu (avatar = profile/services/packages/messages/signout); Check-in is now the
RAISED CENTER icon of the mobile bottom nav (PRO_BOTTOM = overview/clients/checkin/scheduling/payments; .bn-center
FAB style). (b) SCHEDULING: scrapped the weird 10-day arrow strip; rebuilt as Week | Month segmented toggle. Week =
7-day list (today highlighted) with open/full badges; Month = calendar grid (counts per day, tap a day → that week).
prev/next shifts week or month; Today resets. Per-week fetch cached (_proWeekCache), cleared on mutations
(_schedRefresh). (c) SESSION TYPES: FFP_TAX.sessionTypes = {one_to_one:'One on One', group:'Group',
assessment:'Assessment'} (+ serviceTypes/clientStatus/packageTypes/commsChannels/payMethods added to FFP_TAX for
Wave 2). Add-session modal now has a Session type select (saved as slot_type — pro_save_slot already accepts it);
Service is now OPTIONAL (removed the "add a service first" gate); modal retitled "session". Validated week/month +
session-type logic in isolation. PRO_BUILD→13, ffp-taxonomy.js→v10 (pro dashboard). DEPLOY: ffp-professional-
dashboard.html, ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js, assets/ffp-taxonomy.js. WAVE 2 TODO (audit fixes): phone
country-code picker (profile + client modal), source the 6 pick-lists from FFP_TAX in the loaders + drop dead
PRO_TYPE_OPTIONS, FFPSelect.enhance on pro modals (esp. currency).

LATEST-54 (2026-06-14) — PRO dashboard: avatar menu + SCHEDULING REDESIGN. (1) Avatar dropdown now includes
Scheduling + Services + Check-in (were unreachable on mobile — bottom nav only has 4). (2) ffp-professional-
scheduling-loader.js rebuilt from a Mon–Sun week grid to a DATE-SCROLL timetable: horizontal date strip (10 days,
prev/next arrows shift ±7, dots mark days with sessions, Today/Yesterday/Tomorrow labels), tap a date → that day's
sessions; each session card shows an availability badge ("N open" green / "Full") = capacity − booked, tap → existing
openOccActions (reschedule/shift/cancel/edit). "Add session" (openSlotModal) still creates a regular weekly standing
slot. Week occurrences fetched via pro_week_schedule per selected week + cached (_proWeekCache); cache cleared on any
mutation (_schedRefresh). Panel markup: #pro-datestrip + #pro-sched-rangelbl replace the week-nav; CSS injected by the
loader. Validated logic in isolation (open-badge math, day filter, relative labels). PRO_BUILD→12. DEPLOY:
ffp-professional-dashboard.html, ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js.

LATEST-53 (2026-06-14) — MULTI-CURRENCY: bookings.currency stamping + provider listing displays. DB: book_session +
pro_book_slot now stamp bookings.currency = the provider/professional currency (was hardcoded 'AED' in all 4 inserts)
— so refund (toMinorUnits(refunded_aed,bk.currency)) + the paid-confirmation message show the right currency. NEW
helpers in ffp-currency.js (v=2): FFPCurrency.providerCode() + formatProvider(amount) (uses FFP_PROVIDER.currency).
Swapped hardcoded "AED" in the provider listing loaders to the partner currency: classes-loader (card per-person +
"Price per person (CCY)"), members-loader (plan meta + "Price (CCY)"), scheduling-loader (session meta + "(CCY, 0 =
free)" hint), experiences-loader (Trips currency dropdown expanded from 8 → full 54-list, defaulting to partner
currency). Validated helper block (formatProvider AUD/AED). Cache-busts bumped: ffp-currency.js v2 (both dashboards),
classes v12, scheduling v12, members v2, experiences v10. DEPLOY: assets/ffp-currency.js, ffp-provider-dashboard.html,
ffp-professional-dashboard.html, ffp-provider-classes-loader.js, ffp-provider-members-loader.js,
ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js, ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js. STILL TODO: member/booking-side price display
+ admin earnings/payouts display; AUD end-to-end test once a partner connects Stripe.

LATEST-52 (2026-06-14) — MULTI-CURRENCY phase 2: PRO portal UI wired. professional_for_member returns to_jsonb(pr)
so _pro.currency comes through automatically (no RPC change). ffp-professional-dashboard.html: includes
ffp-currency.js?v=1; FFP_PROVIDER.currency=(_pro.currency||'AED'); Currency <select> in the profile form (native
grouped optgroups via FFPCurrency.optionsHtml); saveProfile payload sends currency; the overview aed() formatter now
uses FFP_PROVIDER.currency; PRO_BUILD→11. Loaders made currency-aware (FFP_PROVIDER.currency + FFPCurrency.format):
ffp-professional-billing-loader.js (_money + "Amount (CCY)"), ffp-professional-client-loader.js (_money2 + package
"Price (CCY)"), ffp-professional-services-loader.js (service price display + "Price per session (CCY)"). Validated:
edited blocks node --check OK + runtime confirmed (AUD 150 / AED 75); full-file checks are the known mount-truncation
false EOF. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-dashboard.html, ffp-professional-billing-loader.js, ffp-professional-client-loader.js,
ffp-professional-services-loader.js. STILL TODO: provider listing LOADER price displays (events/experiences/classes/
sessions/plans cards), bookings.currency stamping in book_session/pro_book_slot (so refund/confirm show the right ccy),
member/booking-side + admin display, AUD end-to-end test.

LATEST-51 (2026-06-14) — MULTI-CURRENCY phase 2: PROVIDER portal UI wired. ffp-provider-auth.js (v7) exposes
FFP_PROVIDER.currency (providers.currency). ffp-provider-profile-loader.js (v16): Currency selector (54-currency
grouped picker via FFPCurrency.optionsHtml, searchable) next to the Timezone picker — loads/saves providers.currency
through provider_save_profile; updates FFP_PROVIDER.currency on save. ffp-provider-dashboard.html: includes
ffp-currency.js?v=1, new #pf-currency field markup, loadProfile populates+sets it, _provCcy()/_provMoney() helpers,
and the listing price LABELS now use the partner currency (event "Price (CCY)", trip "Price per person (CCY)", trip
card "CCY n" per-person). ffp-provider-billing-loader.js (v2): _money() now formats in FFP_PROVIDER.currency; payment
amount label "Amount (CCY)". Cache-busts bumped. Validated (billing-loader full node --check OK; auth + profile-loader
edited blocks node --check OK in isolation — full-file checks are the known mount-truncation false EOF). DEPLOY:
ffp-provider-auth.js, ffp-provider-profile-loader.js, ffp-provider-billing-loader.js, ffp-provider-dashboard.html.
STILL TODO: PRO portal (professional dashboard profile selector + aed() formatter + billing/client loaders), provider
listing LOADERS' price displays (events/experiences/classes/sessions/plans), bookings.currency stamping in
book_session/pro_book_slot, member/admin display, AUD end-to-end test.

LATEST-50 (2026-06-14) — MULTI-CURRENCY: comprehensive currency list + save RPCs. NEW assets/ffp-currency.js
(window.FFPCurrency: 54 currencies across ME/Europe/Americas/Asia-Pacific/Africa, each {code,name,symbol,region,
decimals}; .format(amount,code) → "AUD 150", .optionsHtml(sel) grouped <optgroup>s, .byCode/.symbol). Validated
(54 entries; format + CHF/EUR/NOK present). Backend toMinorUnits extended to 3-decimal (KWD/BHD/OMR/JOD/TND →
×1000 rounded to mult of 10) so Gulf currencies are safe too (still v98). provider_save_profile +
professional_save_profile now accept 'currency' (mirrors timezone handling). Live-tested pro currency round-trip
(AUD set + restored to AED). DEPLOY: assets/ffp-currency.js (NEW), backend index.js v98. STILL TODO (UI wiring):
include ffp-currency.js in the dashboards; currency selector in provider/pro profile (FFP_PROVIDER.currency via
ffp-provider-auth.js + profile loaders); swap the hardcoded "AED" formatters in listing forms + billing loaders to
FFPCurrency.format(amount, partnerCurrency); stamp bookings.currency in book_session/pro_book_slot.

LATEST-49 (2026-06-14) — MULTI-CURRENCY minor-units (backend v98). Target markets = sports/fitness/wellness/
adventure tourist hotspots: AED, AUD, NZD, USD, GBP, EUR, THB, IDR, SGD, MYR, VND, PHP, LKR, INR, JPY, CHF, CAD,
ZAR, MXN, CRC, SAR, QAR, MAD, BRL. Added toMinorUnits(amount,currency): zero-decimal currencies (JPY/VND/KRW/… full
Stripe set) charge ×1, all others ×100 — replaced the hardcoded ×100 in all 4 charge endpoints + the refund. Refund
response now returns native amount + currency. Verified behaviourally (AED→×100, JPY/VND→×1). 3-decimal currencies
(BHD/KWD/OMR) deliberately EXCLUDED from the supported set. DEPLOY: backend index.js v98. STILL TODO: frontend
currency selector + label sweep (phase 2), bookings.currency stamping in book_session/pro_book_slot.

LATEST-48 (2026-06-14) — MULTI-CURRENCY build, PHASE 0 + 1 (foundation + backend). Model = per-partner NATIVE
currency (Connect Standard settles in the partner's own currency; no FX in the core flow). Kept the *_aed columns
(now hold the partner's native amount) + added a currency field. DONE: (0) providers.currency + professionals.currency
(text not null default 'AED'); backfilled (4 providers + 1 pro = AED); professionals_public exposes currency;
provider_plans_public + pro_packages_public now also expose the partner currency (joined from providers/professionals)
so the booking site can render the right symbol; member_my_bookings already returns bookings.currency. (1) backend
v97: connectedCheckout charges in String(o.currency||'AED').toLowerCase() instead of hardcoded 'aed'; the 4
/api/pay/* charge endpoints read providers.currency/professionals.currency and pass it. Validated connectedCheckout
in isolation (node --check OK). DEPLOY: backend index.js v97. STILL TODO (phases 2-5, frontend): currency selector in
provider/pro profile + swap hardcoded "AED" labels across listing forms + billing loaders (money helper takes a
currency code); member/admin price displays use listing currency; book_session/pro_book_slot should stamp
bookings.currency = partner currency; AUD end-to-end test once a connected AUD account exists.

LATEST-47 (2026-06-14) — PRO PUBLIC PROFILE fields for booking. Added to professionals_public:
verification_status + languages (columns already existed). Then NEW columns certifications text[] + years_experience
int on professionals; professional_save_profile extended to persist them (certifications mirrors languages array;
years_experience nullable int); both surfaced in professionals_public. Pro dashboard profile form (ffp-professional-
dashboard.html) gained a "Years of experience" number field + "Certifications (one per line)" textarea, saved via the
existing saveProfile payload. LIVE-TESTED the save RPC round-trip on a real pro (certs array + years stored), then
restored to null. saveProfile block node --check OK. Verification stays ADMIN-GATED (view filters
verification_status='approved'; publish→pending→admin approves) — same as partners. OPEN (not changed): editing certs
on an already-APPROVED pro does NOT currently re-trigger pending review (RPC only re-triggers from unlisted/rejected).
Migrations: professionals_public_add_verification_languages, professionals_add_certifications_years_experience. DB is
live (no deploy); DEPLOY only ffp-professional-dashboard.html (form fields).

LATEST-46 (2026-06-14) — BOOKING GAPS #3 + #5 built in BACKEND (index.js v96). #3 REFUND: POST /api/pay/refund
{booking_id} — issues Stripe refund on the SAME connected account as the charge (refund payment_intent/charge with
{stripeAccount}), amount = cancel_booking's computed refunded_aed (fils), idempotencyKey='refund_'+id. Resolves
acct: facility via providers.stripe_account_id, pro via item_id->pro_slots.professional_id->professionals. Guards:
booking must be cancelled + payment_status in (refunded,partially_refunded) + has a PI/charge. Flow = booking site
calls cancel_booking (member-gated) THEN /api/pay/refund. #5 PAID MESSAGE: finalisePaidCheckout now fires
notifyMember (bell+push) once on first paid transition (guarded by reading payment_status before mark, and by the
existing stripe_session_id check for plan/package) — Passport owns the paid message; booking site sends only
"booking received". Block node --check OK in isolation (mount truncates full file). DEPLOY: backend index.js v96
(Vercel). No new env. FFP-BOOKINGS.md updated (#3/#5 now built).

LATEST-45 (2026-06-14) — BOOKING-TEAM GAPS 1/2/4/6 built + live-tested (DB only, no frontend). All verified
against live schema first (RLS, columns, bridges). (1) member_my_credits(p_member) — SECURITY DEFINER; bridges
platform members.id → email → provider_members/pro_clients → active provider_member_plans + pro_client_packages;
returns {facility_plans[],pro_packages[]}. NOTE: those tables are EMPTY in live (0 provider_members/plans/packages)
so only the empty path could be exercised; logic mirrors grant_member_plan's proven email bridge. (2) recreated
professionals_public WITH timezone + payments_status (providers already exposes both via providers_public_read).
(4) member_my_bookings(p_member) — enriched read across all 5 surfaces (experience/event/class_session/
provider_session/professional_session); resolves title + counterparty name + when_at + tz; keyed on bookings.member_id
(platform id, no bridge). TESTED on real data: 6 bookings returned correctly enriched. (6) pro_packages_public view
(active) mirroring provider_plans_public; granted to anon,authenticated. Migrations:
booking_member_credit_reads_and_public_views, booking_member_my_bookings_enriched. FFP-BOOKINGS.md updated with all
signatures. PENDING (need Grant's decision, not built): #3 refund — cancel_booking() exists + computes refund_pct/
refunded_aed but the Stripe money-back must be a backend POST /api/pay/refund on the connected account; #5 who fires
the "payment confirmed" email/bell (avoid double-send with the booking-placed email). These are DB objects (live) —
no file to deploy; backend refund endpoint is the only code item once approved.

LATEST-44 (2026-06-14) — LOGIN "Resend code" FIX. Bug: on the sign-in CODE screen, "Get new code" called
goTo('screen-reset') → bounced the user back to a re-enter-email screen → loop. Fixed across the REAL login
paths: (a) login.html (member + admin) — signin & signup code screens now resend IN PLACE via resendCode(flow)
(re-calls FFPApi.requestCode with the email already on screen, no navigation) + a 60s cooldown
(startResendCooldown) that disables the link and counts down "available in Ns"; cooldown auto-starts when a code
screen is shown. Added a separate "Use a different email" link so changing email is still possible. (b)
ffp-professional-dashboard.html inline gate — ADDED a "Resend code" link (it had none) with the same 60s
cooldown (proResendCode/proStartCooldown). Both blocks node --check clean in isolation.
COVERAGE (verified): member, admin AND PROVIDER all sign in via login.html → so the login.html fix covers all
three. CORRECTION of an earlier wrong note: the provider dashboard's inline #auth-screen (submitEmail/verifyCode
"any 6 digits") is DEAD LEGACY code — ffp-provider-auth.js v5 hides it on load (CSS #auth-screen{display:none})
and, if there's no signed-in ffp_member, redirects to /login (login.html). Provider auth = unified /login flow
(its own header: "All sign-in for ALL roles member/provider/admin goes through /login → Get My Code → 6-digit").
So NO provider-side change is needed. Professional dashboard is the only portal with its own inline gate (fixed).
DEPLOY: login.html, ffp-professional-dashboard.html.

LATEST-43 (2026-06-13) — STRIPE CHARGE LAYER built in the BACKEND (assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js v95).
CORRECTION: I wrongly told the booking team the charge layer didn't exist — facility Connect ONBOARDING was already
wired (v94: /api/facility/connect/start|return|refresh, account links; payments_status not_connected→onboarding→
connected). What was missing = the CHARGE endpoints + pro onboarding. Built (v95): (a) PRO onboarding /api/pro/connect/
start|return|refresh (mirror facility, professionals.stripe_account_id, owner=professionals.member_id, redirects to
PRO_DASH_URL?panel=checkin). (b) CONNECTED-ACCOUNT charges via stripe.checkout.sessions.create(params,{stripeAccount})
— direct charge, zero application fee: /api/pay/session-checkout {booking_id}, /api/pay/pro-session-checkout
{booking_id}, /api/pay/buy-plan {member_id,provider_id,plan_id}, /api/pay/buy-pro-package {member_id,professional_id,
package_id} → return Checkout {url}; success_url→/api/pay/confirm (retrieves session on connected acct, idempotent
finalise) → redirect to BOOKINGS_URL. (c) finalisePaidCheckout shared by confirm + webhook branch (mode='payment' +
metadata.kind) → mark_booking_paid / grant_member_plan / grant_pro_package. Idempotency: provider_member_plans /
pro_client_packages += stripe_session_id (unique). AED, fils. Backend validated (node --check of the inserted block =
clean; full-file error is the mount truncation boundary). Env needed: BOOKINGS_URL, PRO_DASH_URL (opt); platform
webhook must include checkout.session.completed (+ Connect events) for the backup path. NEEDS Stripe test keys + a
connected test account to verify end-to-end before live (can't test charges from here). FFP-BOOKINGS.md updated.
DEPLOY: the backend (Vercel) index.js v95.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-22 — SESSIONS REBUILD: class-template engine (DB) built + tested)
The Sessions model now matches reality. NEW DB engine (applied + live-tested, rolled back):
- **`session_templates`** = the CLASS TYPE (title, activity, description, capacity, price_aed, duration_min,
  hero_image_url, fitness_level, status).
- **`session_slots`** = weekly slots for a template (`day_of_week` 0=Sun..6=Sat, `slot_time`, `coach`).
- **`provider_sessions`** gains `template_id` + `slot_id` = the generated OCCURRENCES (inherit template fields +
  the slot's coach; per-occurrence `coach`/`capacity`/`status` are overridable = substitute/cancel/resize one date).
- RPCs: **`provider_save_session_template`** (upsert template + replace slots + (re)generate next 12 weeks of
  occurrences), **`provider_list_session_templates`** (templates + slots), **`provider_delete_session_template`**
  (archive + remove future occurrences), **`provider_cancel_session`** (cancel ONE occurrence).
  Live test: 2 slots → 24 occurrences (12wk), coaches per slot, correct days, capacity from template. ✅
- ⚠️ v1 regenerates ALL future occurrences on template save (safe now — credit bookings not wired). When credit
  booking lands, regeneration MUST preserve booked/overridden occurrences. TZ of slot_time stored via session tz
  (UTC) — refine if local-time drift appears.
NEXT (building): partner UI (Step1 class + Step2 weekly schedule form; list = one card per class template;
per-occurrence manage: swap coach / change capacity / cancel a single date). Then booking-team builds credit
booking + facility page (see brief below).

### 🅿️ PARKED — credit-based booking + facility page (booking team)
Members book classes against **`provider_member_plans.credits_remaining`** (plans defined in `provider_plans`:
name/plan_type/price_aed/**credits**/period_days). Booking a class = deduct a credit; buying a package = create/
top-up a `provider_member_plan`. Entry point = a **facility page** (provider storefront) listing all the facility's
classes (session occurrences) + packages, with a direct shareable link (main-marketplace routing is clunky). FFP
(Passport) builds the partner side + exposes the data; the booking team builds the member booking + facility page.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-19 — Profile: partner type simplified + discount hidden)
Profile (`ffp-provider-dashboard.html` v60): **Partner type** stays TAXONOMY-DRIVEN (reads `FFP_TAX.providerTypes`
← `taxonomy_items` list_key='provider_type', Admin-editable) — its VALUES were changed (DB + `ffp-taxonomy.js` v11)
to **Single location / Remote / Event organizer** (was the business-type list Gym/Studio/…). **Passport member
discount** field HIDDEN (display:none; FFP is NOT a discount site — kept in DOM so save logic doesn't break).
Deploy: `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v60, taxonomy?v=11), `assets/ffp-taxonomy.js` (v11). DB: provider_type rows replaced.
NEXT (Grant): FEATURED LISTINGS — partners apply to feature a Session/Tour/Event/Trip on the homepage, $99/mo each
(billing mechanics to confirm: manual invoice vs Stripe self-serve). `experiences.featured` already exists; admin
can already feature experiences. Need a partner-facing "Apply to feature" flow + homepage surface.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-18 — Sessions = one strap per session + weekly Timetable tab)
The Sessions list was showing one row per weekly occurrence (a series spammed the list). Now: **one strap per
session** — weekly recurrences grouped by `series_id` (`_dedupeSessions`; earliest occurrence represents the
series; the strap reads "Saturdays · 06:00 · Weekly"). New **"Timetable" tab** (`renderTimetable`) = a Mon–Sun
weekly grid placing each session in its day/time slot (tap a slot → edit). Sessions panel tabs are now
Sessions | Timetable | Attendance. DEPLOY (Netlify): `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` (v5),
`ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v59, cache-bust scheduling?v=5). No DB change.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-17 — Coach PHOTO + bio popup on sessions)
Grant's staff/coach work: a coach **photo + short bio**, captured when the facility adds staff, shown on the
sessions that coach runs (people book for the coach). DB: `provider_staff.bio` + `provider_staff.photo_url` columns;
`provider_save_staff` persists both (provider_list_staff returns them via to_jsonb). **Staff form**
(`ffp-provider-staff-loader.js` v3): "Short bio" field + photo upload (`pickStaffPhoto` → shared FFPUpload,
quest-images bucket). **Sessions** (`ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` v4): coach shows a small photo avatar + is
tappable → popup with the coach's photo + bio + role (fetched via provider_list_staff into `_coachBios`).
DEPLOY (Netlify): `ffp-provider-staff-loader.js` (v3), `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` (v4),
`ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v58, cache-busts staff?v=3 + scheduling?v=4). DB applied (bio + photo_url columns + RPC).
Also: staff **Phone** now uses the standard country-code component (`.phone-cc` from `FFP_TAX.phoneCodes` +
`.phone-num`) — was a plain box (Grant caught it). ROOT-CAUSE FIX: added a **FORM FIELD STANDARDS checklist** to
the build protocol above (phone/activity/city/level/coach/photo/map/number/select each → their required shared
component) + a SECOND-PASS RULE (re-read every form field-by-field against it before "done"). This is to stop the
recurring "hand-rolled field" misses. Audited the 3 forms touched this session — all compliant.
STILL TO COME (Grant, later): link to the coach's FFP Passport, free FFP referral assistance.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-16 — SESSIONS form rebuilt to world-class standard)
The "New session" form (Sessions tab, `provider_sessions`) was raw free-text + native inputs (Grant: "pathetic").
Rebuilt to platform standard (`ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` v2): **Activity** + **City** now use the shared
searchable taxonomy picker (`window.FFPPicker`, same as the listing forms — no free text); **Coach** is a dropdown
of the provider's own staff (`provider_list_staff`); **Location** is a Google Maps **URL**; **Price** labelled
"per person · per session"; **Capacity** has min=1 and is validated ≥1 (was allowing negatives). Required: Title,
Activity, Date, Capacity≥1. DEPLOY (Netlify): `ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js` (v2), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`
(v56, cache-bust ?v=2). No DB change.
NEXT (Grant request, not yet built): Staff get a **photo** (shows on the session — people book for the coach), a
**bio/link**, a **link to their FFP Passport**, and **free FFP referral assistance** — needs the passport-link +
referral mechanics defined before building.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-15 — clean separation + Tours require admin approval)
Final cleanup (Grant: "Tours and Sessions are two separate things, period"; "Tours need to be approved"):
- **Removed the crossover:** dropped `classes.listing_subtype` + `provider_set_class_subtype`. Tours = the whole
  `classes` table; Sessions = the whole `provider_sessions` table. No subtype, no shared toggle.
- **Tours tab** (id `classes`) = one-off Tours only. ONE "New tour" button (no Tours/Classes toggle, no "New class").
- **Sessions tab** (id `scheduling`, `provider_sessions`) stays on the left menu, switched ON, label "Sessions".
- **Create chooser:** Tour → `openCreateClass()` (Tours); Class → `openCreateSession()` (Sessions).
- **TOURS NEED APPROVAL:** new tour submits as **'pending'** (provider_set_listing_status now allows 'pending');
  partner self-publish removed; card shows "Pending admin review"; modal button "Submit for review"; panel shows a
  "reviewed by admin within 24 hours" strip. **NEW admin Tours review:** `ffp-admin-classes-loader.js` (mirrors the
  experiences admin loader) + admin nav "Tours" + `#panel-tours` + `AdminTours` global + lazy/title map entries.
  Approve → `classes.status='live'`; Reject → 'archived'.
- **DEPLOY (Netlify):** `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` (v7), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v55),
  `ffp-admin-classes-loader.js` (NEW — must be committed or 404), `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (Tours panel/nav/maps).
  DB: dropped listing_subtype + provider_set_class_subtype; provider_set_listing_status allows 'pending';
  **classes_status_check expanded to allow 'pending' + 'archived'** (the old check blocked submit-for-review —
  caught by a live test). FULL LOOP VERIFIED LIVE (rolled back): submit=pending → approve=live (bookable=t,
  session scheduled) → reject=archived. ✅
  ⚠️ Front-end not browser-tested — Grant to confirm: New tour → Submit for review → admin Tours (Pending) → Approve → live.
  NOTE for Bookings: Tours from `classes`(+class_sessions) — unchanged contract; subtype field is GONE (ignore it).

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-13 — Tours & Classes are now actually BOOKABLE; one model, settled)
Settled the model after confirming with Bookings: **bookings only work via `class_sessions` (+`classes`),
`item_type='class_session'`** — `provider_sessions` is NOT bookable (no link to classes/bookings, create_booking
doesn't know it). So both Tours and Classes live in **`classes` + `class_sessions`**, split by `listing_subtype`
('tour' | 'class'). **The missing piece (why nothing was bookable): the form never created a `class_sessions`
date.** Fixed: new owner-checked RPCs `provider_save_class_session` / `provider_list_class_sessions` /
`provider_delete_class_session`; the listing form now has a **Date(s) section** (Tour = 1 date, Class = add many),
creates/updates/deletes class_sessions on save, and pre-loads them on edit. Proven live (create→date→go-live):
`session_status=scheduled, class_status=live, bookable=t` (rolled back). **Partner UI:** the listings panel is
"Tours & Classes" with a Tours/Classes view toggle (`setClassView`) + "New tour"/"New class" buttons; both create
via this bookable form. Create chooser routes Tour & Class here. The `provider_sessions` "Scheduling" tab is
re-parked (`soon:true`) — it's a separate non-bookable internal tool, NOT the marketplace path. **DEPLOY (Netlify):**
`ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` (v5), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v53). DB: 3 class_session RPCs applied.
Bookings brief already sent (class_sessions canonical; subtype 'tour'/'class'; Tour date = one class_sessions row).
⚠️ Not browser-tested here — Grant to confirm: New tour/class → add a date → Go live → it shows + books.

ALL FOUR LISTING TYPES — booking path verified live 2026-06-12 (each create→live, rolled back):
- **Tours** (`classes` subtype 'tour') — self-publish; bookable via a `class_sessions` date. ✓
- **Classes** (`classes` subtype 'class') — self-publish; bookable via recurring `class_sessions` dates. ✓
- **Events** (`events`) — date on the row; `create_booking('event')`. Inserts as **'pending' → needs ADMIN approval** to reach 'live' before it's bookable/shown. ✓
- **Trips** (`experiences`) — start/end dates on the row; `create_booking('experience')`. Also **'pending' → ADMIN approval** → 'live'. ✓
(Tours/Classes self-publish; Events/Trips require admin approval — that's the intended gate. Confirm the admin
approve flow works if you want the full Events/Trips loop verified.)

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-12 — SEPARATE Tours vs Classes on the partner platform)
Partners were confused by "Experiences" doing double duty. Split them (Grant): **"Experiences" tab → "Tours"**
(id stays `classes`; one-off activities — jet ski/bungy/canyoning) and **"Scheduling" tab → "Sessions"**, which is
now **switched ON** (was `soon:true`) — recurring **Classes** live here (the existing `provider_sessions` system:
session types incl. class, weekly recurrence, attendance). Nav relabelled; "Coming soon" strips removed from the
Sessions panel; panel headers/copy reworded; the Tours module is tour-only (default `listing_subtype='tour'`, all
copy says "tour"). **Create chooser** now routes: Class→`openCreateSession()` (Sessions tab, waits for the lazy
scheduling loader then `openSessionModal`), Tour→`openCreateClass('tour')` (Tours tab), plus Trip/Event/Challenge.
Overview "New experience" quick action relabelled "New trip" (it opens the Trips modal). **DEPLOY (Netlify):**
`ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v52), `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` (v4). DB: `classes.listing_subtype` +
`provider_set_class_subtype` already applied (LATEST-11/earlier). ⚠️ Not browser-tested here — Grant to confirm:
Tours tab + "New tour" works, Sessions tab opens and "New session" creates a class, and the create chooser routes
both correctly.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-11 — CREATE-EXPERIENCE BUGFIX: the real "classes never saved" cause)
Found and fixed why partners couldn't create an Experience/class (the Viking "classes never wrote to DB" symptom).
ROOT CAUSE: the classes loader is the ONE listing loader that's **lazy-loaded**; "Create → Experience"
(`openCreatePicker`) and the panel's "New experience" button ran `showPanel('classes'); openClassModal()` — but
`showPanel` only *starts* fetching the loader script (async), so `openClassModal()` on the next line was undefined
on first use and **silently did nothing** → no modal, no insert. FIX: new `openCreateClass()` in
`ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v50) loads the loader then opens the modal once `openClassModal` is registered;
both create entry points route through it. BACKEND VERIFIED LIVE (insert→publish→rolled back): `provider_save_listing`
kind=class returns a real id and persists all fields incl `fitness_level`/`city`; `provider_set_listing_status`
draft→live returns 'ok' and the row goes `status='live'`. So save/publish was always fine — the break was purely
this front-end race. **DEPLOY (Netlify):** `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v50). DB unchanged.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-10 — PROFILE COMPLETION + "listings hidden until complete" notice)
Made profile completion meaningful and tied it to whether listings show. **(1) Completion reworked to the real
storefront ESSENTIALS:** business name, category, city, about (≥40 chars), logo, hero photo, and ≥1 activity —
`computeProfileCompletion` + new `profileEssentials()`/`profileMissingEssentials()`/`profileIsComplete()` in
`ffp-provider-dashboard.html`. The OLD calc required `website` + all 7 days of hours, so 100% was unreachable
(those are now non-blocking "recommended extras"). **(2) Notification:** the completion card now says "your
listings won't appear on Find Fit People until your profile is complete" + lists exactly what's missing; and a
yellow warning banner (`renderListingGate` in `showPanel`, hidden once complete) appears at the top of every
listing panel (Events/Experiences/Trips/Challenges/Deals) with the missing items + a "Complete profile" button.
Gated on `providerProfile.status` so it never flashes before data loads. **(3) Live activity sync:** profile
loader (`ffp-provider-profile-loader.js` v14) now keeps `providerProfile.activities` current as chips are
added/removed and re-renders completion + the banner immediately (was only read at load). **DEPLOY (Netlify):**
`ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (v49, loads profile loader ?v=14), `ffp-provider-profile-loader.js` (v14). DB
unchanged. ⚠️ Not browser-tested from here — Grant to confirm: incomplete profile shows the banner on listing
panels + the % card lists missing items; completing all essentials clears it. NEXT: the create-listing flow
itself end-to-end (the original "partners can actually list" goal).

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-9 — UNIFIED LISTING FIELDS: one taxonomy, one level scale, one city picker)
Unified the partner listing forms so they're consistent and world-class (NOT a platform change — just unifying
what exists, so partners can create proper listings). **(1) Killed the Trips hardcoded city list** —
`ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js` had a dead, corrupted `FFP_CITIES` object (541 cities, with stray markdown/doc
text pasted into the Turkey array); removed it — country/city already came from the shared `window.FFP_TAX.cities`
via the searchable pickers. **(2) ONE connected LEVEL scale** — a member's own ability AND a listing's required
level now use the SAME vocabulary: `FFP_TAX.fitnessLevels` = Not Tried/Social/Competitive/Representative/
Professional; new `FFP_TAX.attendeeLevels` = those + "All Levels" (the listing "who can attend?" question),
**derived from fitnessLevels so they can't drift** (rebuilt on DB hydration). Trips + Events + Experiences level
fields all read `attendeeLevels`; killed the per-form hardcoded lists (Trips `FITNESS_LEVELS`, Events copy, and the
Experiences orphan "Difficulty" Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced box — replaced with "Fitness level required" saving
to `fitness_level`; verified `provider_save_listing` class branch persists it). Default level = "All Levels".
**(3) ONE city picker** — Events + Experiences country/city converted from native `<select>` to the shared
searchable picker (`window.FFPPicker.openCountry/openCity`), the SAME component as Trips + the activity field — no
more native dropdowns. **DEPLOY (Netlify):** `assets/ffp-taxonomy.js` (v10), `ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js`
(v7), `ffp-provider-events-loader.js` (v10), `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` (v2), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`
(cache-busts: taxonomy ?v=10, experiences ?v=7, events ?v=10, classes ?v=2; + Events "Level" select now reads
attendeeLevels). DB unchanged (verified only). ⚠️ Not browser-tested from here — Grant to open each form once and
confirm the level dropdown + city picker render and a listing saves. NEXT: same picker/level unification on the
remaining forms (Profile/Quests/Challenges) if wanted; then the broader "partners can list" flow.


Started the facility-payments build (let facilities collect real card payments — memberships/packs/drop-ins — via
**Stripe Connect Standard**, money → facility's own Stripe → their bank, **zero FFP per-transaction fee**; FFP
monetizes later via a flat monthly SaaS fee, §9 of spec). Today's facility billing was **record-keeping only**
(`provider_payments` logs amounts, no card charge) — this is the gap. **Phase 1 (onboarding) built:** DB
`providers + stripe_account_id/stripe_connected_at/payments_status`; backend **index.js v93** `POST
/api/facility/connect/start` (refresh-token auth → owner check → Stripe OAuth URL, signed 10-min state) + `GET
/api/facility/connect/callback` (oauth.token swap → save account id → bounce to Billing); portal
**ffp-provider-dashboard.html v47** "Connect Stripe" card in Billing + `?stripe=` bounce-back. Platform acct =
Find Fit People LLC FZ (`acct_1Le2g8BnpbSTlIOB`). **Grant must:** Stripe dashboard Connect setup + set backend env
`STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID` / `STRIPE_CONNECT_REDIRECT_URI` (+ optional `PROVIDER_DASH_URL`). **Deploy:** backend →
Vercel, dashboard → Netlify; DB live. Full plan + remaining phases (2 plans→Stripe, 3 enrolment+card capture, 4
webhooks/freeze/dunning, 5 member self-serve, 6 FFP SaaS fee): **FFP-FACILITY-PAYMENTS-SPEC.md**.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-7 — partner listing forms + new Experiences module + Duplicate)
Wired the GYG-parity fields into the partner portal and built the missing module. **Save engine:**
`provider_save_listing` extended to persist all new fields on event/experience + a NEW `class` branch (native
classes insert as `draft`); helper `ffp_jsonb_to_text_array`; `meeting_point` added to events/experiences.
**Trips form** (`ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js` v6): + Highlights + "Good to know" (Languages, Min age,
Not-allowed, Meeting point + coords, Accessibility, Cancellation). **Events form** (`ffp-provider-events-loader.js`
v9): DOM-injected "Good to know" section with the same fields + Includes/Not-included. **NEW Experiences module**
(= `classes` table, customer-facing "Experiences" = classes/tours): `ffp-provider-classes-loader.js` v1 (list +
full create/edit modal + self-publish draft→live via `provider_set_listing_status` + delete + duplicate) wired
into `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` v46 (nav item, #panel-classes, _provLoaderSrc lazy-load, showPanel dispatch,
create-listing chooser). Renamed existing listings "Experiences"→"Trips". **DUPLICATE** on every listing card →
`duplicateListing()` → `provider_duplicate_listing` (deep-copies all fields + clones listing_media) → reloads via
`window.FFPReload[kind]` + opens the "(Copy)" draft to edit. New DB RPCs: `provider_duplicate_listing`,
`provider_set_listing_status`; `provider_delete_listing` gained a class branch. All verified live (create/edit/
publish/duplicate, rolled back). **Member-facing detail display = findfitpeople.com (booking team)** per spec —
not a Passport build. **Deploy (Netlify):** ffp-provider-classes-loader.js (new), ffp-provider-dashboard.html,
ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js, ffp-provider-events-loader.js. DB already live.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-12 (LATEST-6 — listing detail fields, GYG parity)
Benchmarked the partner listing forms against GetYourGuide (Grant's reference). Finding: media gallery
(`listing_media`) + reviews (`item_reviews`) already cover those GYG blocks for all three types; the gaps were the
**standardised structured-text sections + filterable attributes**. Naming locked: **Experience=`classes`
(classes/tours), Events=`events` (paid/free), Trip=`experiences` (retreats/camps/sports-event trips)**. Added the
shared DB columns (migration `listing_detail_fields_gyg_parity`, additive/idempotent): `classes` got the full
19-field set (highlights, what_included/what_not_included, meeting_point+lat/lng, what_to_bring, not_allowed,
know_before, languages, min_age, difficulty, fitness_level, wheelchair_accessible, accessibility_notes,
free_cancellation_hours, cancellation_policy, itinerary, distance_km); `events` + `experiences` got their
gap-fillers (highlights, meeting coords, not_allowed, languages, min_age, accessibility, cancellation; events also
what_included/what_not_included/know_before). Bullet fields = `text[]`. Verified all live. **Remaining = booking
team**: wire the inputs into the 3 create/edit forms + render the standard section stack on the detail page. Spec
+ per-form field list + display guidance: **FFP-LISTING-FIELDS-SPEC.md**.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-11 (LATEST-5 — Passport booking check-in + shared check-in modes)
Built the **Passport booking-scan UI** (audit open item #3 → BUILT). `ffp-member-checkin-loader.js` **v8**: after a
venue scan, the member's bookings there (via `member_bookings_at_venue`, time-aware) surface as "Your booking(s)
here" → tap → `booking_checkin` (geo-verified ≤250m, idempotent/day, logs `activity_logs` → passport stamp/stats).
Verified live RPC shapes match the UI: `member_bookings_at_venue` returns `booking_id/title/scheduled_at/checked_in_today`;
`booking_checkin` returns `{ok,verified,title}` + errors `not_your_booking`/`booking_cancelled`/`booking_refunded` —
all handled. **NEW shared MODE flag** so the FFP Booking platform reuses the SAME file: `data-mode="booking"` (or
`window.FFP_CHECKIN_MODE='booking'`) renders **bookings + events ONLY** (no quests/challenges/meetups/visit-logging,
per Grant); default `passport` mode = full. Member dashboard → **v359** (loader `?v=8`). ⚠️ `booking_checkins`
still = 0 rows → confirm FFP Booking QR reader calls `booking_checkin`; the 2 existing bookings have
`scheduled_at=NULL` (always shown — fine for testing; booking team to confirm new bookings set it).
**Deploy (Netlify):** `ffp-member-checkin-loader.js` + `ffp-member-dashboard.html`. DB unchanged (RPCs already live).

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-11 (LATEST-4 — full audit + security pass) → see FFP-AUDIT.md
Reviewed the live structure (Supabase security advisors 377 lints + performance 239 + auth paths). Verdict: strong
architecture, a few quick security fixes (done), scale-readiness debt (deferred). **Fixed:** `event_results` +
`pr_history` had RLS DISABLED (anon-key exposed) → RLS enabled (RPC-only; verified the Results tab + Connections
feed RPCs still work post-RLS). `payout-receipts` bucket was PUBLIC (financial docs via CDN) → flipped PRIVATE +
admin payouts loader now uses `createSignedUrl` (1yr); admin dashboard **v47** (lazy cache-bust v=52). **Reviewed,
intentionally kept:** `professionals_public` SECURITY DEFINER view (correct curated PII-free public projection;
an anon table policy would EXPOSE phone/email), `provider_applications` open INSERT (public apply form; reads
admin-gated), the ~346 anon-executable definer-function warnings (the architecture — members are anon). Open items
(priority): ✅ #1 find-or-create-by-email CLOSED (booking team's shared `ensure_member()` RPC); ✅ #2
`bookings.scheduled_at` CLOSED (added + wired → I made `member_bookings_at_venue` TIME-AWARE, sessions around now;
`cancel_booking` live, status='cancelled'+14-day refund, check-in RPCs already refuse cancelled/refunded). STILL
OPEN: build Passport booking-scan UI (booking_checkins still empty — confirm the new QR reader calls
`booking_checkin`); perf clean-up before traffic; harden explicit-id RPCs; finish member-dashboard monolith
extraction. Full report: **FFP-AUDIT.md**.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-11 (LATEST-3 — SOURCE OF TRUTH: pricing, referral=recurring, ownership doc)
⚠️ **SUPERSEDES the old membership doctrine below** ($99/yr and "10% discount" are DEAD). Canonical now:
**`FFP-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`** + DB `platform_docs` key='source_of_truth' (public read — the booking platform reads it).
- **Pricing = SUBSCRIPTION: 7-day trial · $20/mo · $149/yr.** Backend (index.js v80) + login v13 + homepage +
  member gate v340 already wired ($PRICE_MONTHLY/$PRICE_ANNUAL, trial_period_days:7, /api/billing/checkout). Verified.
- **NOT a discount site** — Passport gives NO booking discount. Value = identity/loyalty/progress.
- **Referral = RECURRING:** referrer earns tier% (5/10/20) of EACH paid Stripe invoice, for the life of the
  referred member's subscription (backend `creditReferralForInvoice`, already live — v64/v46). FRONTEND was stale
  ("% of $99" one-time) → FIXED: `ffp-constants.js` v2 (membershipUsd 99→149 + recurring note); member dashboard
  **v358** referral display now shows the **tier %** + "recurring" (earn-refer-rate/rm-rate), copy reframed, dead
  **JOIN_URL** ($99 one-time link) removed. Backend correct, no backend change needed.
- **One identity, two surfaces** (email = identity; idempotent find-or-create by email on BOTH platforms; guest
  checkout; upgrade flips membership flag — no second account). **Booking management = findfitpeople.com only;**
  Passport shows read-only "My bookings" + check-in. **Check-in = free-account action (facility QR or email),**
  reusing the venue-scan pattern; Passport adds stamp/stats on top. All locked in the source-of-truth doc.
- DEPLOY (Netlify): `assets/ffp-constants.js` (v2), `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (v358). DB: platform_docs upserted.
- **BOOKING CHECK-IN CONTRACT — LIVE (shared write target for both surfaces).** Table **`booking_checkins`**
  (booking_id, member_id, provider_id, occurrence_date, lat/lng, verified; unique(booking_id, occurrence_date)).
  RPCs: **`member_bookings_at_venue(p_member,p_provider)`** ("which booking are you here for?" — title/status/
  checked_in_today/is_returning) + **`booking_checkin(p_member,p_booking,p_lat,p_lng)`** (geo-verify ≤250m like
  member_event_checkin, idempotent per booking+day, logs an activity_logs row for stamps). Facility QR encodes
  **provider_id** (venue=provider; no venue table yet). Marketplace booking check-in is NEW (the venue scan only
  covered quests/challenges/events; bookings had no check-in field). Passport scan = TODO (extend
  ffp-member-checkin-loader.js to surface member_bookings_at_venue → confirm → booking_checkin → stamp). Booking
  platform owns the write from its free-account check-in. Contract in FFP-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md §6 + platform_docs.
  Recommended to the booking team: add `bookings.scheduled_at` (no session date/time on the booking row today).

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-11 (LATEST-2 — pro portal polish + photo-save bugfix)
- **Modals → FULL-BLEED** on the professional dashboard (platform standard; `openModalShell` no longer caps
  width) + the member data-sharing modal (`ffp-pro-access-loader.js` v2). **OVERVIEW shows TODAY's sessions
  only**; yesterday/tomorrow/week stay in Scheduling.
- 🐞 **PROFILE-PHOTO SAVE BUG FIXED:** the photo uploaded fine (blob in quest-images) but `profile_photo_url`
  stayed null because the save RPC was called **un-awaited** — supabase-js v2 query builders are LAZY and only
  fire on await/then. `pickProPhoto` now awaits the save + handles errors. (Backfilled Grant's existing photo.)
  ⚠️ LESSON: any `supabase.rpc()`/`.from()` whose result you don't use STILL must be awaited or it never runs.
- **LANGUAGES spoken** added to the profile (`professionals.languages text[]`, toggle chips + Other) — in
  `professional_save_profile`. **PHONE** field already added (`professionals.phone`).
- **Scheduling: 'Initial / assessment' slot type** (SLOT_TYPES in the scheduling loader; `pro_slots.slot_type`
  is free-text so no DB constraint change; capacity treated as single like 1-to-1 via SLOT_SINGLE).
- Pro lazy loaders cache-bust via **PRO_BUILD='7'**. Pro dashboard → **v7**. Member dashboard pacc ref → `?v=2`.
- DEPLOY (Netlify): ffp-professional-dashboard.html (v7), ffp-professional-scheduling-loader.js,
  ffp-professional-client-loader.js, assets/ffp-pro-access-loader.js (v2), ffp-member-dashboard.html. DB live.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-11 (Pro ↔ client READ-ONLY DATA SHARING, member-permissioned)
A professional can view a client's **Calorie Tracker + Fitness Stats READ-ONLY, only with the member's
approval**. Consent flow (locked w/ Grant): pro requests → member approves in Passport → pro views →
member can revoke; **client must hold an active FFP Passport** (matched by email); access lasts **until revoked**.
- **DB `pro_client_access`** (professional_id, member_id, client_id, status pending/approved/declined/revoked,
  unique pro+member). RPCs: **`pro_request_data_access`**(p_pro,p_client → match client email→member, require
  `member_passport_active`, upsert pending, notify member), **`pro_client_access_status`**(for the client screen),
  **`member_pro_access_list`** + **`member_respond_pro_access`** (approve/decline/revoke; **hardened with
  `auth.uid()`** — members' auth.uid()=member id; approve notifies the pro's bell), **`pro_client_data`**
  (STRICTLY gated by an approved grant → read-only snapshot from `food_logs`+`profile_meta`+`activity_logs`).
  Verified live: refuses without grant; with an approved grant returns member + fitness PRs + activities + calories.
- **Pro side** (`ffp-professional-client-loader.js`): each client row has a Health-data button →
  `openClientHealth` (request / pending / approved→read-only Calorie+Fitness view). Pro loaders now cache-busted
  via **`PRO_BUILD`** in the dashboard (`ensureProviderLoader` appends `?v=`).
- **Member side**: new **`assets/ffp-pro-access-loader.js`** (deferred, `window.FFPProAccess.open()`, self-contained
  modal) + a **"Data sharing"** item in the member user-menu + **auto-opens on `?proaccess=1`** (the notification
  deep-link). Member approves/declines/revokes here. Member dashboard → **v357**.
- **DEPLOY — Netlify:** `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (v6) + `ffp-professional-client-loader.js` +
  `assets/ffp-pro-access-loader.js` (NEW) + `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (v357). DB live. No backend change.
- 💡 **PARKED IDEA (Grant 2026-06-11):** session **check-in via the pro's QR** (or pro checks the client in) →
  **90 min after check-in, prompt the client to REVIEW the session** → review posts to the **public storefront**.
  Ties into the existing venue check-in pattern + the professional verification/storefront. Scope before building.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-10 (Professionals Portal v5: + frozen header, notifications, feedback, phone)
**v5 polish (on top of v4 below):** topbar is now a FROZEN sticky header with a NOTIFICATIONS bell
(reuses member `/api/notifications/{id}` — a pro is a member; `professional_set_verification` posts an
approve/reject notification to that bell) + the FEEDBACK widget (`ffp-feedback-widget.js`,
data-source=professional). Primary nav trimmed to **Overview/Clients/Scheduling/Payments**; **Profile +
Packages + Messages moved into the avatar menu** (`PRO_NAV_EXTRA`). Added **`professionals.phone`** + a
Phone field on the profile. DB: `professionals.phone` + phone in `professional_save_profile` +
verification-notification insert in `professional_set_verification` (all live). Deploy = the same
`ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (now **v5**) + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (v46) + the new admin loader.
PARKED (Grant "not sure yet"): trainer-sees-client calorie/fitness-stats vs. trainer↔client messaging — decide before building.

**Built "all seven" in dependency order (DB → shell → overview → storefront → verification).**
- **Pro dashboard `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` v4** — MOBILE-FIRST, Passport-style. Bottom tab nav on
  phones (`.bottom-nav`, `PRO_BOTTOM`=overview/clients/scheduling/packages/payments) + sidebar collapses
  `@media(max-width:859px)`. Topbar **AVATAR menu** (`#av-menu`: My profile + Sign out) — sign-out now under
  the avatar like other dashboards. `PRO_NAV` gained **overview** (first) + keeps profile last.
- **OVERVIEW = default landing** (`showPanel('overview')` in enterDashboard). `renderOverview()` reuses
  **`pro_business_report`** (collected_month / clients_active / outstanding_total / standing_slots) + slices
  **`pro_week_schedule`** for yesterday/today/tomorrow sessions (fetches adjacent weeks at week boundaries).
- **PWA opens straight to an INLINE professional sign-in** (`#gate-signin`, purple) — boot() shows it instead
  of `location.href='/login'`, so the FFP Professional icon never shows the portal picker. Uses
  `FFPApi.requestCode/verifyCode('signin')` (already stores ffp_member) → `boot()`. (Grant: "the only option
  should be sign in to Professional portal".)
- **STOREFRONT (profile editor):** profile **PHOTO** upload (`FFPUpload.pick` → bucket **`quest-images`** key
  `pro-profile-{id}`, aspect 1 — reuses the allowed member-upload bucket so NO backend/bucket change; needs
  `assets/ffp-image-upload.js?v=6` + cropperjs, now loaded in the head). **Up to 4 PROFESSIONS** — the same
  searchable picker in multi-select mode (`_pfProfs`, target `'pfmulti'`, first = primary → drives category).
  **VIDEO links** (YouTube/Vimeo/IG) via `pro_videos` table + `pro_videos_list/_save/_delete` RPCs.
- **VERIFICATION (public listing needs approval):** `professionals.verification_status`
  (unlisted→pending→approved/rejected) + `verification_note/verified_at/by`. Ticking "List me on Find Fit
  People" → `professional_save_profile` flips it to **pending** (publish→pending logic in the RPC); pro sees a
  review banner (`renderVerifBanner`). **Admin → Professionals** (`#panel-professionals` + new
  **`ffp-admin-professionals-loader.js` v1**, lazy ?v=51) lists pending pros with Approve & publish / Reject
  (note) via **`professional_set_verification`** (is_admin-gated) + **`professional_verification_list`**.
  Public visibility = `is_published AND verification_status='approved'`.
- **DEPLOY — Netlify:** `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (v4) + `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (v46) +
  `ffp-admin-professionals-loader.js` (NEW — must be committed or 404). **DB live** (pro_videos + verification
  columns + 5 RPCs + extended professional_save_profile). No backend/Vercel change. ffp-image-upload.js + cropperjs already deployed.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-10 (Professionals Portal: professions taxonomy + picker + emblem icon)
**Context: Grant flagged 3 problems with the professional onboarding I'd shipped — fixed all + logged (Issue P1 below).**
- **PROFESSIONS ARE NOW A DB TAXONOMY (Admin-editable).** New `taxonomy_items` list_key **`professional_role`** — 178
  service-professional roles, each row's **`parent` = one of the 6 STANDARD FFP categories** (Sports · Fitness ·
  Wellness · Recovery · Adventure · Health food). Manage in **Admin → Taxonomies → Professions** (new list in
  `ffp-admin-taxonomies-loader.js` **v6**, with a per-row **Category** selector mirroring the category→passport cell;
  reuses `setCatPassport` since both write `parent`). Service pros ONLY — business owners / athletes / creators dropped.
- **`assets/ffp-taxonomy.js` v9:** `professionalRoles` regrouped under the 6 categories (was made-up headings like
  "Strength & Body Composition") + **DB-hydrated** from list_key='professional_role' (group by parent, canonical
  category order, admin-added categories appended). New helpers `T.professionalCategories`, `T.professionalRolesFlat()`
  (flat [{name,category}] A–Z), `T.categoryOfRole(role)`. Referenced `?v=9` on admin + professional + profile-complete
  pages; **member/provider/signup left at `?v=8` on purpose** (they don't consume professionalRoles → no behaviour
  change; avoids risky edits to the huge member/provider files). They'll pick up v9 on their next own change.
- **ONE searchable Profession picker** (FFP standard: tap-to-open + search at top, modeled on profile-complete's sport
  picker). `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` **v3**: onboarding + profile editor both use it (hidden input
  `ob-/pf-profession` + button + `openProfPicker`/`renderProfPickList`/`pickProfession`). Category is **auto-derived**
  from the chosen profession (no separate category step) and stored on **`professionals.category`** (new column; both
  `professional_link` + `professional_save_profile` RPCs now persist it). Removed the old category→profession cascade
  + `EXCLUDED_PRO_CATS` hack.
- **Pro home-screen icon = REAL FFP EMBLEM + "PROFESSIONAL"** underneath, on white (same family as the Passport icon).
  Regenerated `assets/icons/ffp-pro-{32,180,192,512}.png` from `assets/ffp-emblem.png` (32px = emblem only). **The
  purple "FFP/PRO" mark is gone.** `ffp-pro.webmanifest` icons set to purpose **"any"** (was "any maskable") so the
  edge-reaching wordmark isn't clipped by Android's circular maskable crop. Sidebar brand also changed from text
  "FFP PRO" → emblem + "FFP **Professional**".
- **DEPLOY — Netlify:** `ffp-admin-dashboard.html` (v45) + `ffp-admin-taxonomies-loader.js` (v6) + `assets/ffp-taxonomy.js`
  (v9) + `ffp-profile-complete.html` (taxonomy ?v=9 bump) + `ffp-professional-dashboard.html` (v3) + `ffp-pro.webmanifest`
  + the 4 `assets/icons/ffp-pro-*.png`. **DB live** (taxonomy rows + professionals.category + 2 RPCs). No backend/Vercel change.

### 🐞 ISSUE P1 (2026-06-10) — professional onboarding shipped sub-standard; Grant caught it
Three faults in the professional onboarding I'd built, all now fixed: (1) **invented categories** — I grouped
professions under made-up headings ("Strength & Body Composition" etc.) AND hardcoded them in JS instead of using
the 6 standard categories + Admin Taxonomy. (2) **purple FFP/PRO logo** — off-brand; the FFP emblem is essential.
(3) **profession was a 2-step native-select cascade** — should be ONE searchable picker (the FFP standard). Root
cause: built on assumptions without locking the spec to FFP's existing standards (categories, brand emblem, picker
pattern). Lesson re-banked: reuse the proven platform pattern + the real brand assets; don't invent taxonomy or art.

## 🧭 BUILD PROTOCOL & CONVENTIONS — READ FIRST, FOLLOW EVERY TASK
_The operating manual. If a change skips a step here, it's wrong. (Reinforced 2026-06-05 after a session that thrashed by skipping these — the protocol existing isn't enough; it has to be followed.)_

### The 10 rules
1. **READ THIS FILE FIRST** — every session, every task.
2. **LOCK THE SPEC before code.** Anything subjective (UX / gamification / "feels right") → restate it in one line, get a yes, THEN build. No building on a guess.
3. **REUSE THE PROVEN PATTERN** (see §0a REUSE RULE below). Find how it's already done here and copy it. Any taxonomy/list field (activity, country, city, level) = the shared SEARCHABLE PICKER `window.FFPPicker` reading `window.FFP_TAX` — NOT a native `<select>` (raw native dropdowns look amateur; the listing forms were unified onto the picker 2026-06-12). Native `<input>` is fine for free text. A feature module = the existing `assets/ffp-*-loader.js` shape. No bespoke widget when a platform pattern exists.
4. **ONE CHANGE AT A TIME** — make it → verify it → next. No stacking unverified edits.
5. **VERIFY AGAINST TRUTH** — real code / DB / live behaviour; quote the exact line. Never theorise a cause.
6. **VALIDATE BEFORE "DONE"** — isolation-test the changed logic; `node -c` new modules. NOTE: the sandbox shell serves a stale/truncated view of big files, so its `node -c` on them gives false EOF errors — validate the changed logic in isolation instead, and trust the Read/Edit tools as canonical.
7. **VERSION + CACHE-BUST EVERY CHANGE** (see the vN rule above) — and **one version lineage per file** (no double-numbering).
8. **SHARE EVERY CHANGED FILE — ALWAYS, in the SAME message as the change.** Attach the actual file(s) via the file cards. NEVER name, describe, or say "deploy X" without attaching X — a change isn't delivered until the file is shared (Grant can't pull it from thin air). If 3 files changed, all 3 get attached together. Keep version notes in the file header, not chat. _(Non-negotiable — repeatedly missed 2026-06-05.)_
9. **IF IT BREAKS: REVERT FIRST**, diagnose second — get back to known-good, then investigate.
10. **WORLD-CLASS UX, ALWAYS.** Every screen, field and flow is designed to a best-in-class standard — nothing ships that looks or feels amateur. Consistent shared components, the searchable pickers (never raw native dropdowns), clean layout, sensible defaults, clear labels, no dead/duplicate options. If it wouldn't sit comfortably next to the best apps in the category, it's not done. _(Added 2026-06-12 — Grant: "We create and design based on BEST WORLD CLASS user experience.")_

### 📋 FORM FIELD STANDARDS — CHECK EVERY FIELD AGAINST THIS BEFORE BUILDING/EDITING ANY FORM
_(Added 2026-06-12 — Grant kept having to catch hand-rolled fields. This is the cure: NEVER hand-roll a field
that already has a shared component. Before writing a form, open an existing standard form (provider profile /
a listing form) and COPY the component. Then check each field below.)_

| Field | REQUIRED component (copy it) | Never |
|---|---|---|
| **Phone** | `.phone-input` → `<select class="phone-cc">` (filled from `FFP_TAX.phoneCodes`) + `<input class="phone-num">` | a plain text phone box |
| **Activity / Category** | `window.FFPPicker.openActivity` (searchable taxonomy) | free text or native `<select>` |
| **Country / City** | `window.FFPPicker.openCountry/openCity` (or `FFPLocation`) ← `FFP_TAX.cities` | free text or a hardcoded list |
| **Level / Difficulty / "who can attend"** | `FFP_TAX.attendeeLevels` / `FFP_TAX.fitnessLevels` (the one shared scale) | a per-form hardcoded list |
| **Coach / staff person** | dropdown from `provider_list_staff` | free text |
| **Photo / logo / hero / avatar** | shared uploader `FFPUpload.pick({bucket:'quest-images',…})` | a raw URL text field for an image |
| **Map / location** | a URL field (Google Maps link), `type="url"` | a vague free-text "location" |
| **Number (capacity/age/price)** | `type="number"` with sensible `min` (capacity `min="1"`) + validate | unbounded (lets users enter -1) |
| **Fixed enum (status/type)** | the platform `.select` styled class | a raw/unstyled `<select>` |
| **Price** | label the UNIT explicitly (per person / per session) | an ambiguous "Price" |
SECOND-PASS RULE: when adding any form, immediately re-read it field-by-field against this table BEFORE saying "done".

### ⚡ Performance conventions (permanent — learned 2026-06-06)
- **Scripts load `defer` (or lazy) — never a plain synchronous `<script src>`.** A sync external script mid-document blocks the HTML parser until it downloads; two of them buried ~10.5k lines into the member dashboard stalled boot (Bio felt 7–8s). Feature/panel/core scripts get `defer` — they still run before DOMContentLoaded, and the boot `init()` is DOMContentLoaded-gated, so `window.X` is defined in time.
- **Repeated heavy SVG is deduped with `<use>`.** Define a heavy shape ONCE (in `<defs>` as `<g id>`/`<symbol>`) and `<use>` it per instance — never redraw it N times. The laurel wreath was ~28 gradient leaves on EVERY badge (×100+ on a big ladder); deduping to one `<use>` per badge fixed the slow Milestones render.
- **De-fragile the member dashboard by extraction.** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` is a ~14k-line monolith (all panels inline) — the root of its fragility. Standard: pull each panel into its own module (core `assets/ffp-<panel>-core.js` deferred + lazy `assets/ffp-<panel>-loader.js` for data), leaving the dashboard a thin shell (skeleton + nav + auth/boot + panel-loader map). Done: Fitness Stats. Next: Calorie Tracker (+ My Meals), then Passport/Connections, Quests, Profile.

### 🎨 DESIGN — no amateur "boxes"
- **No decorative background / opacity boxes or "cards" as containers** — they make the platform look amateur (Grant, 2026-06-06). Use clean spacing, hairline dividers and typography instead; reserve filled surfaces for genuinely interactive chips/buttons. Legacy boxy UI gets stripped when you touch that screen.
- **Standard action button = YELLOW** (`var(--yellow)` / `#FFCC00`, dark text), e.g. the calorie "Log food" / "New meal" / "Save". Blue is secondary.
- **Time entry = single-tap SCROLL WHEEL** (`window.FFPDurationPicker`, H/M/S) — never `+/-` steppers or digit boxes. Wired into the Records time editor (Bronco, 5K/10K/Half/Marathon, Swim) and Log Activity duration.
- **NO native / "apple" dropdowns** (`<select>` incl. `.ffp-select`) — Grant HATES them, off-brand (2026-06-07). For a small fixed set of choices use an FFP **segmented toggle** (`.chal-seg` pattern: row of pill buttons, selected = yellow). For larger lists use a custom tap-to-open sheet. Existing `<select>`s get replaced when you touch that screen (backlog: purge platform-wide). **Also NO native date / time / datetime inputs** (`<input type="date|time|datetime-local">`) — Grant hates these too (2026-06-07). Use the FFP wheel pickers: `window.FFPDurationPicker` (H/M/S) for durations, `window.FFPDateTimePicker.open(startIso, maxDays, cb)` (Date/Hour/Min wheels, in ffp-member-discovery-loader.js) for date+time. Native date/time inputs are still scattered across provider/admin/log-activity/meetup forms — same backlog purge. Photo input = square tap-to-add tile, no label text.

### ⛔ NEVER bash/Python-rewrite the big files
The sandbox Linux mount serves a TRUNCATED copy of large files (e.g. ffp-member-dashboard.html ~12k lines) — a Python/bash read-modify-write writes the truncated copy back and SILENTLY LOPS OFF THE TAIL (lost the gate + `</body></html>` on 2026-06-07, recovered by hand). Use the **Edit tool only** (canonical) for the dashboard + any large file. Bash is fine for `node --check` of small NEW files, but treat its reads of big/edited files as unreliable (stitch-verify). Header/changelog trims on big files = Edit tool, not Python.

### ⭐ BRAND — who we are
FFP / Find Fit People is the **world-leading active-lifestyle community of ATHLETES**. Everything we ship pushes members toward GREATNESS — it is NOT built for lazy people. Tone, copy, gamification and especially the milestone system must feel ambitious, athlete-grade and aspirational.

### 🏅 MILESTONE SYSTEM DOCTRINE (Milestones tab) — LAW, READ BEFORE TOUCHING LADDERS
**RULE #1 — FREQUENT WINS, ALWAYS.** (Said dozens of times. Stop breaking it.) The gap between consecutive milestones NEVER balloons — from the first badge to the last. A member must ALWAYS have a near-term next badge in reach. You reach big aspirational tops by adding MORE stages, **never** by widening the gap. Early gaps tiny (1, 2, 3…); later gaps grow only gently and stay capped. A giant late jump (e.g. 3200 → 4000) is WRONG and means the ladder failed this rule.
- **5-YEAR PLAN:** each journey's top (Legend) ≈ a serious athlete's ~5-year grind — earned, not handed out.
- **Structure:** 8 JOURNEYS, each its own object badge, recolouring across 8 LEVELS (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Emerald → Sapphire → Amethyst → Ruby → Legend). The tab shows ONE badge tile per journey (member's current level colour + earned/total); tapping a tile opens that journey's FULL ladder. Earned = level colour, locked = grey.
- **The journeys (badge) — each metric is its OWN journey/tile; do NOT collapse lifts or run distances into one:** Activities Logged (medallion + number) · Deadlift / Back Squat / Bench Press (weight plate — ×bodyweight, 0.1 steps) · Sports Variety (ball — count of unique sports) · 5K / 10K / Half Marathon / Marathon (stopwatch — DROPPING TIME per distance, many sub-time tiers; **NOT hours**) · VO₂ Max (heart) · Cities (skyline — to ~200) · Body Fat (scales — % dropping 34→8) · Quests (map) · Meetups (wreath + 4 people) · Connections (wreath + 2 people). More distances/lifts/metrics can be added as their own journeys anytime.
- **Code:** ladders + badge art live in `assets/ffp-milestone-badges.js` (`window.FFPMSBadges`). The lazy loader `assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js` ONLY gathers the member's numbers and calls `FFPMSBadges.render(values, gridEl)`. Ladders are built by a capped-gap generator so "frequent wins" is enforced in code, not by hand. Dashboard includes the module via `<script src="assets/ffp-milestone-badges.js?v=N">` — bump that `?v` on every badge change.
- **Data sources:** Activities, lifts (deadlift/squat/bench), runs (5K/10K/Half/Marathon PRs), VO₂, Cities, Body Fat = Fitness Stats / Records; Meetups = `member_meets`, Connections = `member_connections_count`, Quests = `member_quests_completed` (RPC: count of `quest_progress` rows with `status='completed'`). TODO: Endurance ultra tiers need ultra-distance tracking; run/lift/VO₂ journeys only fill once the member logs those PRs on the Records tab.

### File map (what's what)
- **Frontend (Netlify · ffppassport.com):** `ffp-member-dashboard.html` (its `FFP_BUILD` cache-busts the lazy loaders), `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`, `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`, `login.html`, `ffp-profile-complete.html`, `provider-signup.html`. Feature modules are lazy-loaded from `assets/ffp-*-loader.js` (cache-busted via `FFP_BUILD` / `?v=`).
  - **MODULE PAIRS — change one, CHECK ITS PARTNER (this is where fuck-ups happen):** each big panel = a deferred CORE (the engine: object + render, `assets/ffp-<panel>-core.js`, loaded `<script defer src=...?v=N>` in the dashboard so `window.X` exists before the DOMContentLoaded-gated boot `if (window.X) X.init()`) PLUS a lazy LOADER (`assets/ffp-<panel>-loader.js`, fetched only when the panel opens, busted by `FFP_BUILD`) that wires it to Supabase by overriding core methods by name.
    - **Fitness Stats:** `ffp-fitness-stats-core.js` (deferred `?v=`) + `ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js` (lazy, `FFP_BUILD`). The loader also owns the **Records model** (`METRICS` + `PR_MAP`) and the **milestone wiring** (`renderMilestones` → `FFPMSBadges`).
    - **Calorie Tracker:** `ffp-calorie-tracker-core.js` (deferred `?v=`) + `ffp-calorie-tracker-loader.js` (lazy, `FFP_BUILD`). The loader owns **My Meals** + all Supabase writes.
    - **Connections:** `ffp-connections-core.js` (`window.MeetMove` matches/discover/meetups + `window.CollectionView`) + `ffp-meet-move-loader.js` (lazy, Supabase data). ⚠️ The core is a **CLASSIC (non-defer) `<script src=…?v=>`** loaded right BEFORE the Matches-deck IIFE — because that IIFE does `Object.assign(MeetMove,…)` at PARSE time, so a deferred core would be too late and the deck would silently not wire. Boot calls it guarded: `if(window.MeetMove) MeetMove.init()`. Extracted from the dashboard 2026-06-07 (v323) to de-bloat (~852 lines out). Bump the core's own `?v=` on change.
    - **Connections FEED (v324):** `ffp-connections-feed-loader.js` (deferred, `window.FFPConnFeed`) renders `#conn-panel-root` in `#panel-meet` — discovery strap (→ `MeetMove.openMatchesGrid`), "My connections" most-active circles (→ `CollectionView.openPerson` / See all → `CollectionView.open`), and a "From your people" feed. Data: one RPC **`member_connections_panel(p_me)`** → `{connections:[id,name,photo,city,active,act_count], feed:[{type,actor_id,name,photo,title,sub,icon,link,when}]}`. Feed = notifications-to-me (pre-formatted) + connections' upcoming meetups + live-challenge joins + `activity_logs` (14d) + birthdays (`members.date_of_birth`). Tap routes by `type`: meetup→meetups panel+`openMeetupDetail`, challenge→challenges panel+`Challenges.openDetail`, activity/birthday→`openCard`, **pr→`congratulate`** (`member_congratulate` RPC → bell notification), notif→its link. Renders eagerly on load (loader v2+) so it never sticks on the skeleton. Bump feed loader `?v=` + `FFP_BUILD` on change.
    - **PR history → congratulate (v326, was #85):** `pr_history` table + **trigger `trg_log_pr_history` on `profile_meta`** (`log_pr_history()`) — logs one row whenever a PERFORMANCE PR column improves (bench/squat/deadlift/5k/10k/21k/marathon/swim1k/bronco/beep/vo2; higher-or-lower aware; going forward only, no backfill). `member_connections_panel` surfaces connections' `pr_history` (14d) as `type:'pr'` feed items; feed loader taps → `member_congratulate(p_me,p_to,p_metric)`. To celebrate more metrics, add the col to the trigger's VALUES map.
    - ⚠️ **MEMBERS ARE THE `anon` ROLE to Supabase** (anon key + custom JWT; SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET path doesn't make them `authenticated`). So: member writes MUST go through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (granted to `anon,authenticated`) — direct table writes under `authenticated`-only RLS will fail for members. **Storage**: member uploads need an **`anon` policy** on the bucket (e.g. `quest-images insert/update anon`) — `authenticated`-only storage policies (avatars, ffp_media_*) block members. This is why provider uploads work (providers authenticate) but member challenge photos were RLS-blocked until the anon policy was added.
    - **RACE RESUME — event results (v327):** `event_results` table + RPCs (`member_event_result_save`/`_delete`/`member_event_results` → results + stats Events/Podiums/Top10 [podium/top10 = best of overall OR age-group placing] + milestone counts). UI = **`ffp-event-results-loader.js`** injects a **Results tab** into Fitness Stats `#fs-tabs` (+ `#fs-results-view`) — self-contained (own delegated tab handler), doesn't touch the fitness-stats core. Log form: Individual/Team (team name + teammates), overall + age-group placings, FFP **past-date** wheel (`DatePicker`, Day/Month/Year), optional photo (`quest-images`). Results post to the Connections feed (type 'pr' → congratulate). **Event list = admin-managed taxonomy `event_catalog`** (public-read; `admin_event_catalog_save/_delete/_list` guarded by `is_admin()`); loader reads it (fallback list if unread). **DONE:** Events is now an admin **taxonomy** (`taxonomy_items` list_key='event'; manage in Admin → Taxonomies → Events; the old `event_catalog` table was dropped). **DONE:** 2 milestone journeys — **Competitions** (medallion) + **Running Races** (stopwatch) in `ffp-milestone-badges.js` v6, fed by `member_event_results` milestone counts via `ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js` v32 (`fetchMsSocial` → `values.comps`/`values.runRaces`). Fitness Stats tab order: Activity · Bio Age · Records · Results · Milestones. STILL TO DO: remove dormant `#panel-events` from the Passport (Events now lives on findfitpeople.com).
    - **Milestone badges:** `ffp-milestone-badges.js` (deferred `?v=`, `window.FFPMSBadges`) = badge art + ladders; CONSUMED by `ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js`. Change a badge/ladder → bump its `?v=` in the dashboard tag.
  - **CACHE-BUST — always do BOTH sides:** a LOADER change → bump `FFP_BUILD` (busts every lazy loader). A deferred CORE/module change (`*-core.js`, `ffp-milestone-badges.js`) → bump ITS `?v=N` on the dashboard `<script>` tag (own version lineage). Every changed file ALSO bumps its own header `vN` + changelog (rule #7). **Deploy a core/module + the dashboard together.**
  - **CORRESPONDING DATA CHAINS — change one, change ALL:**
    - **New Record (PR) — FIVE places, ALL required (learned the hard way 2026-06-06):** in `ffp-fitness-stats-core.js`: (1) `prDefs` (drives the EDITOR + card — miss it and the card shows but **won't open**) AND (2) `_prCol` (+ `_prInt` if integer) — the SAVE key→column map; **miss it and Save silently does nothing** (this is what broke Bronco even after prDefs+RPC). In `ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js`: (3) `METRICS` + (4) `PR_MAP` (leaderboard + load-back). DB: (5) a `profile_meta` column **AND** add it to the `member_profile_meta_save` RPC whitelist (miss the RPC → won't persist). Then bump the core `?v=`. e.g. Bronco=`pr_bronco_sec` (int), Beep Test=`beep_test_level` (numeric).
    - **New milestone journey:** ladder/badge in `ffp-milestone-badges.js` + feed its number from `ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js` (`renderMilestones` values) + a data source (a Fitness Stats field or an RPC).
    - **My Meals:** `member_meals` table + the 4 `member_meal_*` RPCs + the `ffp-calorie-tracker-loader.js` UI; `member_meal_log` writes a `food_logs` row.
    - **Member-created Challenges (2026-06-07) — see FFP-SCOPE-member-challenges.md:** DB (`challenges.score_direction`, `challenge_entries.proof_url`, unique idx `challenge_entries_uniq_member`, + RPCs `member_challenge_create` / `_submit_score` / `_verify_entry` / `_leaderboard`) ⇄ member UI in **`ffp-member-discovery-loader.js`** (overrides the inline `Challenges` demo; `FFP_BUILD` on the dashboard busts it) ⇄ admin take-down in **`ffp-admin-challenges-loader.js`** (`?v=` on admin dashboard `_lazyInit`). RULES: member challenges go LIVE on create, **30-day cap** (clamped in RPC), **NO prize** (leaderboard only: podium top-3 + top-10), **honor-system scores**, **host** sets a verified badge, submitter adds **photo proof** (reuses public bucket `quest-images`). GOTCHAS (real constraints): `challenges.verification` CHECK allows only `peer`/`none` (member create uses `peer`); `status` allows `pending/live/closed/past/archived` → **take-down reuses `archived`** (no new status); member discovery loader must fetch **`status='live'` only** (else pending/archived leak into the member "Past" tab); active/past derived by `ends_at`, not status. The whole leaderboard was demo-only before this (loader hardcoded empty) — submit + leaderboard are now real via the RPCs.
  - **Scope docs:** `FFP-SCOPE-calorie-tracker-mymeals.md`, `FFP-SCOPE-event-attendance.md`, `FFP-SCOPE-*` — read the matching scope before touching that feature.
- **Backend (Vercel · ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app):** `assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/ffp-passport-backend-main/index.js` — auth/JWT, Resend email, notify endpoints, quests API.
- **DB (Supabase `kxzyuofecmtymablnmak`):** shared by Passport + Find Fit People; schema/RPCs applied live via MCP.
- **Shared spec:** Integration Contract — canonical in `platform_docs`, mirror `FFP-INTEGRATION-CONTRACT.md`.

### Who writes what (one shared DB)
Membership fields + the $99 subscription = **Passport only**. Per-booking payments + member discount = **Find Fit People**. Providers / listings / taxonomy / storage / auth = **shared**. (Full table: Integration Contract → "Ownership at a glance".)

### Deploy
- **Frontend** change → push to GitHub → Netlify. Bump the page's `vN` + `FFP_BUILD` / `?v=` so loaders re-fetch.
- **Backend** change → push → Vercel. Bump the `vNN` marker.
- **DB** change → applied live via MCP (no deploy).
- After any deploy, smoke-test the critical flows: **login · check-in · log activity · booking-notify**.

## 🎟️ EVENT ATTENDANCE FLOW (2026-06-04) — see FFP-SCOPE-event-attendance.md
**Model:** open RSVP → member's Passport on the guest list → at the venue, scan the VENUE QR → tap the event → check in (auto-attended) → counts toward "events attended". NO provider pre-approval.
- ✅ **Check-in → attended ALREADY existed & verified:** venue scan surfaces events (`venue_active_programs`), tapping → `member_event_checkin` writes `event_checkins` (idempotent, geo-verified ≤250m) AND logs an 'Event' activity. No build needed.
- ✅ **RSVP email trail BUILT + verified (DEPLOY PENDING):**
  - DB `rsvp_event` now drops an in-app notification on the provider's bell ("X is coming to your event"). Live-tested (Grant→Forge → provider 7b0307bf got the notif; test rows cleaned).
  - **backend index.js v73** (Vercel): new `POST /api/events/notify {kind:'rsvp'}` → emails the MEMBER ("You're confirmed to attend …") + the PROVIDER ("X RSVP'd …"). New `sendEventRsvpMemberEmail`/`sendEventRsvpProviderEmail`. node-checked (additions ~L1043-1095 parse clean).
  - **discovery-loader v6** (lazy via FFP_BUILD): after `rsvp_event`, POSTs `/api/events/notify`; toast → "check in with your Passport on the day".
  - **member dashboard v284** (FFP_BUILD=284): RSVP-confirm copy fixed (dropped misleading "organiser manages the guest list").
  - **DEPLOY:** DB live → Vercel (index.js v73) → Netlify (dashboard v284 + discovery loader). 
- ✅ **PROVIDER GUEST LIST BUILT (DEPLOY PENDING):** `provider_event_roster(p_me,p_event)` owner-gated SECURITY DEFINER RPC (returns RSVP'd members' passport info + `checked_in`). **provider-events-loader v7** injects a "Guest list" section into the event modal (photo + name + city, "Going"/"Checked in" badge, "N going · M checked in" header). **provider dashboard v31** loads it at `?v=7`. node-checked + roster RPC live-tested (owner sees roster, non-owner sees nothing). DEPLOY: DB live → Netlify (provider dashboard v31 + loader).
- ⏭️ STILL OPEN: **"Events attended" stat** — data ready (event_checkins + 'Event' activity logs); needs a PLACEMENT decision because `.hero-stats` is a fixed 4-col × 2-row grid (8 tiles full). Options: add a 9th tile (uneven 3rd row), swap one, or make the grid auto-fit. Ask Grant.

## ⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE — BUMP vN ON EVERY CHANGE (Grant, 2026-06-04)
**Every time ANY file is edited, bump its version number — no exceptions, however small the change.**
- HTML pages: bump the version in the file's header comment (e.g. login.html v7→v8, profile-complete v32→v33, member dashboard vN) AND `FFP_BUILD` where present (member dashboard) so loaders re-fetch.
- Loader/asset JS: bump the `vN` in the file's top comment AND the `?v=N` cache-bust everywhere it's referenced — they move TOGETHER (cache-bust drift = stale file served; see Issues #5/#8).
- Backend index.js: bump the `vNN` marker in the touched section.
- This applies to tiny CSS/one-line fixes too. If a file changed, its version changed.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-05 (LATEST — current versions + cross-project build)
- **LOGIN LOCKOUT FIXED (email case).** Sign-in matched email **case-sensitively** while stored emails are
  lowercase, so a capitalized email (autocapitalized first letter) made `/api/auth/reset` return `exists:false`
  → the v8 login `exists` gate showed "account does not exist" and blocked login. Fix: **backend v75** normalizes
  email to `.trim().toLowerCase()` at every member-touch point (`/api/auth/signin`, `/reset`, `/signup`, the
  Stripe webhook, `/api/onboard/from-stripe`); **login.html v9** lowercases client-side too. Verified all 9
  stored emails were already lowercase (matches every account, breaks none). _Immediate unblock: type email
  lowercase._ DEPLOY: login.html→Netlify, index.js→Vercel.
- **FORM-CONTROL STYLING — REVERTED to the proven native pattern (lesson learned).** I built a custom JS dropdown/
  date/time widget (member v300/v301, provider/admin v43, profile v35, signup v3). It replaced the native
  `<select>`/`<input>` with a `<button>`+panel that did NOT inherit each page's field CSS, so dropdowns rendered
  BLANK on every page (Grant deployed member v300 and hit it live). Per protocol (§0a REUSE RULE — reuse the proven
  pattern, don't invent), the widget was **fully removed** from all 5 pages. Dropdowns/date/time are now plain native
  fields styled by the existing CSS (`.ffp-select`, `select{}`, etc.) — exactly like every other field. Member
  dashboard is now **v302** (FFP_BUILD 302, native fields); the other 4 reverted to their prior versions (provider
  v42, admin v42, profile v34, signup v3). `assets/ffp-fields.js` is a dead tombstone (safe to delete). Member
  dashboard v299 also relabeled Log Activity "Time" → "Time Of Day" (kept). **RULE REINFORCED: a styled field = a
  native `<select>`/`<input>` + CSS. Do NOT build bespoke control widgets.**
- **Member dashboard v296** (FFP_BUILD 296): NAV refocused → **Passport · Connections · Meetups · Quests ·
  Challenges** (Events/Experiences tabs removed = Find Fit People marketplace; Check-in = the Scan QR button on
  the Passport home; Meetups split out of Connections into `#panel-meetups`). MEMBERSHIP GATE (v294: free/lapsed
  members → "Join Passport $99/yr" screen, fail-open, via `member_passport_active`; `JOIN_URL` (dashboard v320)
  → the LIVE Stripe Payment Link `https://buy.stripe.com/00w5kCgHcejw9c003F3Nm0s` — the SAME $99 checkout used
  at signup in login.html that paying members go through; Stripe collects email → `/api/onboard/from-stripe`
  upgrades them to passport). MY COLLECTION rebuilt (search + tap → flippable passport card + **Recommend**
  (`member_recommend_passport` → bell notification) + **Remove** (`member_connection_remove`)).
- **Provider dashboard v42** + profile loader v13: Passport-member **DISCOUNT** field
  (`providers.passport_discount_pct`; Business Details; blank = platform default 10%; booking reads it). Plus
  the image-storage wiring (logo/hero/listing covers → Storage).
- **Backend index.js v74** (Vercel, DEPLOY PENDING): **POST /api/notify/member** `{to_member_id,subject,heading,body}`
  (shared member email via Resend; Find Fit People calls it for booking confirmations + pairs with a
  `notifications` insert for the bell). NOTE the file header was stale at v70 — v71 (auth refresh), v72 (meetup
  approval emails), v73 (event RSVP emails) were already in the code; marker now reconciled to v74.
- **DB live:** membership model (`members.membership` default 'free' + `passport_expires_at`; `member_passport_active`
  gate); `providers.passport_discount_pct` + updated `provider_save_profile`; `member_connection_remove` +
  `member_recommend_passport`; **`platform_docs`** (canonical Integration Contract row `key='integration_contract'`,
  public read, `platform_doc_get`).
- **DEPLOY PENDING — Netlify:** member dashboard v296, provider dashboard v42, profile loader v13,
  `assets/ffp-image-upload.js`, `ffp-provider-venue-qr-loader.js?v=2`. **Vercel:** backend v74.
- See **FFP-INTEGRATION-CONTRACT.md** (synced mirror) + the `platform_docs` DB row for the Passport⇄FFP spec.

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-05 (image storage)
### IMAGE STORAGE STANDARDISATION — base64-in-DB → Supabase Storage (in progress)
- Shared uploader **assets/ffp-image-upload.js** = `window.FFPUpload` (pick / cropFile / uploadFile / uploadBlob): pick → optional crop (Cropper) → resize → Storage → returns public URL (+`?v=` cache-bust so re-uploads to a stable path actually refresh). **Owner id comes from the JWT `sub` (=auth.uid), NOT the record id** — the provider RECORD id ≠ the owner's auth id, which caused the storage 400. Referenced at **?v=6** by provider + member dashboards → bump `?v=` in BOTH when this file changes (manifest rule).
- Buckets (all public; owner-keyed RLS: folder = auth.uid, admin override): provider-logos, provider-heroes, event-covers, meetup-covers, experience-covers, **listing-covers** (all provider listing heroes). `avatars` (existing, flat `{id}.jpg`) unchanged.
- ✅ DONE: provider **logo+hero** (crop: logo 1:1, hero 16:9; provider dashboard `handleUpload('logo'|'hero')`); provider **listing covers** — events/experiences/challenges/deals/quests all share `handleUpload('listing:…')`+`#listing-photo-slot` → one fix → `listing-covers`; member **meetup cover** (`pmfPickCover` → `meetup-covers`).
- ✅ DONE: **profile-complete avatar** (v34) — photo is picked BEFORE the member exists, so onboard now sends `photo_url:null` and the avatar uploads to `avatars` AFTER onboard (member.id + JWT live → auth.uid passes RLS), reusing ffp-photo-upload.js's exact path + PUT `/api/members/:id`. NON-BLOCKING (a photo error never blocks signup). So ALL upload surfaces are now Storage-backed (feedback widget stays base64 by design, §6t).
- ✅ MIGRATION DONE (2026-06-05): ran server-side via a one-time secret-guarded edge function `ffp-migrate-base64` (service-role auto-injected — never handled the key client-side). Converted **all 12 remaining base64 rows** → Storage: members.photo_url ×5 → avatars/{id}.jpg; events ×3 + experiences ×2 → listing-covers/{owner}/…; meetups ×2 → meetup-covers/{host}/…. Verified: **0 base64 rows left** platform-wide, bytes present in Storage (avatars 7, listing-covers 5, meetup-covers 2). The function was then **decommissioned** (redeployed as an inert 410; delete it from the Supabase dashboard at leisure). `scripts/migrate-base64-images.mjs` kept as a local-run reference but no longer needed.
- VERSIONS: provider dashboard **v41**, member dashboard **v292** (FFP_BUILD 292). Also fixed: dead `<script>` ref to `ffp-provider-quest-analytics-loader.js` (file doesn't exist) removed; `ffp-provider-venue-qr-loader.js` (no `?v=` → was stale, still selected non-existent providers.passport_no = the console 400) now busted `?v=2`. **DEPLOY all together; assets/ffp-image-upload.js is a NEW file — it MUST be committed to the repo or it 404s → returns HTML → FFPUpload never loads → uploads break.**

## 🧭 PRODUCT BOUNDARY — TWO APPS, ONE CORE (LOCKED by Grant 2026-06-05)
Two products on ONE shared Supabase DB (members, providers, listings, stamps, payments, the 6 categories, Storage):
- **FFP Passport** (this member app) = identity / loyalty / social. Owns: passport + stamps, member-to-member
  (Connections/Matches + **Meetups / Meet & Move — PASSPORT ONLY, member-to-member, free**), venue **check-in**
  (collect stamps), Quests, Fitness stats, Earnings. Members do **NOT** book paid stuff here — they **link out to
  Find Fit People**, book there, then **check in with their Passport** to mark it + collect the stamp.
- **Find Fit People** (findfitpeople.netlify.app) = the **MARKETPLACE**: discover / book / pay — **Experiences**
  (classes/sessions/padel courts), **Trips** (retreats/camps/adventures), **Events**. Stripe/AED, partners keep 85%.
- **Events = provider/partner-created ONLY** → live on Find Fit People. NOT member-created. In Passport, events are
  read-only "what I've booked / checked into," never a browse-or-create surface.
- **ONE provider portal** (the provider dashboard) → evolving into a **FACILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**: partners manage
  listings (sold on FFP), venue/QR check-ins, members, quests, hours — one place, serves both products. Don't split
  provider features across two apps.
- **CLEANUP for Passport:** strip the marketplace bleed (experiences/events/deals discovery+booking) out of the
  member app → replace with link-outs to Find Fit People; keep Passport focused on identity / connect / meetups /
  check-in / quests / fitness.

## 🔗 SHARED DOCS — canonical in the DB (2026-06-05)
The cross-project **Integration Contract** (Passport ⇄ Find Fit People) is stored canonically in the SHARED DB:
`platform_docs` row `key='integration_contract'` (public read; helper `platform_doc_get('integration_contract')`).
Both projects READ the DB row = one source, no drift. Passport MAINTAINS it — `FFP-INTEGRATION-CONTRACT.md` is the
editing surface; **on every contract change, re-run the `platform_docs` upsert so the DB row matches the file.**
`platform_docs` is admin-write / public-read. (FFP-MASTER stays Passport-internal; not shared.)

## 💳 MEMBERSHIP MODEL — ONE IDENTITY, TWO TIERS (LOCKED + APPLIED 2026-06-05)
$99/yr Passport is a **paid status on a shared account**, NOT a separate login. Find Fit People bookings are
open to anyone (free account via email+code, or guest checkout).
- `members.membership` text NOT NULL default **'free'** (check free|passport). Every booking-site signup is a
  free booker automatically.
- `members.passport_expires_at` timestamptz — the $99 buys 12 months. **Separate from `tier`/`tier_expires_at`**
  (that's the loyalty/ambassador tier — do NOT conflate).
- **CANONICAL GATE — both apps call this, never re-implement:** `member_passport_active(p_id uuid) -> bool` =
  `membership='passport' AND coalesce(passport_expires_at,'infinity') > now()`. SECURITY DEFINER, granted
  anon+authenticated. NULL expiry = active (fail-open, no accidental lockout). Verified live (Grant = true).
- Backfill done: **7 paid members → 'passport'** + expiry = created_at+1yr (all active); **2 → 'free'**.
- OWNERSHIP: **Passport project OWNS/WRITES these fields; Find Fit People only READS them** (one writer = no
  duplicate-column drift — the booking project flagged this risk and we agreed the split).
- DECISIONS (Grant + booking project): (1) bookers = free account (live on FFP) + guest checkout; (2) $99/yr =
  auto-renewing Stripe **subscription** (Passport build); (3) member perk = **10% discount at checkout** — lives
  on the BOOKING site, reads `membership`; (4) stamps stay members-only (the upgrade hook).
- STILL TO BUILD — **Passport side:** app GATING (login → free/lapsed user → "join/renew Passport" screen, not
  the full member app) via member_passport_active; the $99 Stripe subscription + expiry/renewal + reminders.
  **Booking side:** guest checkout + the 10% member-discount-at-checkout (reads membership).

## 🟢 SESSION STATE — 2026-06-04 (read this first when resuming / new chat)

### 📱 TODO on next touch — iOS input-zoom fix (per PAGE, not per loader)
iOS Safari auto-zooms the whole page when you focus an input with `font-size < 16px`. Fix = a page-level CSS
rule forcing inputs to 16px on mobile. **DONE on the member dashboard (v280):**
`@media (max-width:768px){ input,textarea,select,.pm-form-input,.pm-form-textarea,.ffp-select{font-size:16px!important;} }`
This rule is page-wide, so it ALSO covers every loader-injected form on the member dashboard — loaders need NO change.
**Still to add (drop the same block into each page's `<style>` on its next update):**
- [ ] `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (covers all provider loaders' forms) — only if providers use it on mobile
- [ ] `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`
- [x] `login.html` — DONE: `.field-input` 15→16px (OTP `.code-digit` left at 24px). Page already had `maximum-scale=1`.
- [x] `ffp-profile-complete.html` — DONE: `.field-input,.field-select` 15→16px.
NOTE: don't blanket-force `input{font-size:16px}` where a field is intentionally LARGE (e.g. login's 24px OTP boxes) — that would shrink it. Bump only the sub-16px field classes, or exclude the large ones.
Caveat: a loader that sets input `font-size` with its OWN `!important` would override the page rule — fix that loader's value to 16px if so. Otherwise no loader edits needed.


**ALL FILES DEPLOYED + LIVE as of 2026-06-04** (Grant confirmed pushed; Netlify + Vercel). Current live versions (verified 2026-06-04: backend path-route live, admin footer "build v41", member features present):
- 🤝 **MEETUP REQUEST→HOST APPROVAL (2026-06-04, built — DEPLOY PENDING)** — see FFP-SCOPE-meetup-approval.md. Fixes the bug where joining a meetup auto-confirmed + emailed instantly (no host step).
  - **DB (live now)**: `meetup_attendees` status check now allows **`pending`**; `join_meetup` inserts `pending` (was `joined`) + notifies the host; new **`host_approve_attendee(p_host,p_meetup,p_member)`** (host-check, capacity = approved+host < max, set `joined`, notify member). Verified live: request→pending(+host notif), non-host→forbidden, approve→joined(+member notif), re-approve→already, test rows cleaned.
  - **backend index.js v72** (Vercel): `/api/meetups/notify` new **`kind='request'`** emails the HOST (`sendMeetupRequestEmail`); `kind='confirm'` now fired on APPROVAL, not on join.
  - **meet-move loader v24** (Netlify): `requestJoin` → pending + host `request` email (no auto-confirm); fetches member's pending (`pendingByMe`) + host pending queue (`pendingRequests`); host detail modal shows **"Requests to join (N)"** with Approve → `host_approve_attendee` → member `confirm` email. node-checked.
  - **member dashboard v278** (FFP_BUILD→278): amber **"Requested"** card badge + disabled "Requested ✓ — awaiting host" detail button.
  - **DEPLOY**: DB already live → Vercel (index.js) → Netlify (loader + dashboard). Rollback = deploy history.
  - ✅ Follow-ups BUILT (dashboard v279 + loader v24, DEPLOY PENDING): (a) **attendee cancel** — `leave_meetup(p_me,p_meetup)` RPC (cancel anytime BEFORE start → frees a spot; 'started' guard) + "Cancel my spot"/"Cancel request" button in detail; dropped the "12h" promise. Tested live (future→left, past→started, Grant's RSVP restored). (b) **host meetup photo** — `meetups.cover_url` column + host_meetup/update_meetup pass it through; photo field in the post/edit form (downscaled ≤1200px JPEG data-URL via pmfPickCover) → loader shows `img = cover_url || category image`. All new JS node-checked. DEPLOY: DB live → Netlify (dashboard v279 + loader). NOTE: cover stored as data-URL per "how our site stores images" (Storage migration still a future task).
- 🔐 **KEEP-MEMBERS-SIGNED-IN (2026-06-04, built — DEPLOY PENDING)** — see FFP-SCOPE-keep-signed-in.md.
  - **assets/ffp-api-integration.js v12**: ONE Supabase client (dynamic per-request JWT header → kills the `Multiple GoTrueClient` warning, refreshed JWT applies instantly); "Keep me signed in" storage toggle (localStorage=persist / sessionStorage=session-only); silent `refreshSession()` on boot + once on 401 (fail-safe — a refresh miss never logs anyone out). Validated: full-file node --check CLEAN + storage behaviour tested (existing localStorage sessions are NOT logged out by the upgrade).
  - **backend index.js v71** (Vercel): access JWT 30d→**7d**; new `mintRefreshToken`/`verifyRefreshToken` (HMAC, 365d, stateless — same pattern as provider token); signin + onboard return `refresh`; **new `POST /api/auth/refresh`** (verify refresh → re-mint jwt+refresh; requires member active). Refresh logic unit-tested (roundtrip/tamper/forge/expiry/garbage all correct).
  - **login.html**: "Keep me signed in on this device" checkbox (default ON) → `FFPAuth.setPersist()` before tokens are stored.
  - **Cache-bust**: all 5 pages now load `ffp-api-integration.js?v=12` (login, member v277, provider, admin, profile-complete) — was un-busted.
  - **Verified no breakage**: NO code anywhere uses GoTrue sessions (`signInWithPassword`/`setSession` absent project-wide); all `supabase.auth.getUser/getSession` calls already fell back to FFPAuth, so `persistSession:false` changes nothing for them. Admin + provider auth don't touch `supabase.auth`.
  - **DEPLOY ORDER**: Vercel (index.js) first, then Netlify (the 5 HTML + ffp-api-integration.js). Client refresh is fail-safe so order isn't fragile. Rollback = Netlify/Vercel deploy history.
- ffp-member-dashboard.html **v277** (FFP_BUILD=276; loads ffp-api-integration.js?v=12) · assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js **v23** · ffp-member-checkin-loader.js **v7** (ref ?v=7)
  - v276 + loader v23: FIX Discover "No meetups match those filters". Console truth: the deployed meet-move LOADER (`?v=275`) threw `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'the' (line 2)` → never ran → MeetMove.data empty. DB/RLS/filter/container all verified fine; only the loader failed to parse. Republished clean loader v23 + bumped FFP_BUILD→276 so browsers fetch `?v=276` fresh. **⚠️ MUST DEPLOY BOTH dashboard v276 AND assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js — deploying only the dashboard re-fetches the same broken loader.** See FFP-ISSUES-LOG #8. (Note: sandbox mount has a hard ~32KB file-read cap → can't node-check large files there; verified via partial-parse + file-tool tail read.)
  - v275: 🔴 CRITICAL FIX — the WHOLE dashboard was dead ("not responding"). Console truth: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier '_nowTs' has already been declared (line 12577)`. The v273 Past-tab edit added `const _nowTs` at the top of MeetMove.filtered() while the Discover branch already had `var _nowTs` — duplicate declaration = parse error = entire `<script>` dead (so v274 never even ran). Fix: Discover reuses the top-level `_nowTs`. Verified: node --check of the full visible script body = clean; all added identifiers unique. **See FFP-ISSUES-LOG #7. Rollback safety net = Netlify "Publish deploy" on the last good deploy.**
  - v274: FIX passport panel FROZEN / "not responding" on refresh (FFP-ISSUES-LOG #6). Root cause: prerenderPassportShare() runs html2canvas (heavily synchronous) and was auto-fired EAGERLY on load (1.5s) + every panel-show (450ms) → blocked the main thread 1-3s right after refresh on the default passport panel. Now deferred via requestIdleCallback (schedulePassportPrerender) so it never blocks first paint/interaction; coalesces to one; re-arms after share. html2canvas scale 2→1.5. **DEPLOY RULE: bump FFP_BUILD.**
  - v273: Meet & Move PAST tab (was hard-coded `items=[]`) now shows your past meetups (joined or hosted); Going/Hosting are UPCOMING-only (past ones move to Past, clean split, no overlap). Discover already shows only upcoming. NOTE: 2 upcoming meetups exist (Town Square Loop, Morning run) — if Discover is empty for the user they're not yet on v271 (country filter) + v272 (loader cache-bust).
  - v272: PERMANENT FIX for lazy loaders disappearing after deploys (FFP-ISSUES-LOG #5). All panel loaders now share ONE cache-bust **FFP_BUILD** (= the dashboard build number; bump together) — no per-loader ?v=N drift, no un-busted loaders. ensurePanelLoader RETRIES on failure (3x backoff) + marks done only on onload. **⚠️ DEPLOY RULE: bump FFP_BUILD (in setupPanelNav) every deploy — it cache-busts every lazy loader.** This removes the per-loader ?v refs (earnings/fitness/meet) from _panelLoaderSrc.
  - v271: (a) FIX RECURRING "no meetups on Discover" — the Discover country filter checked m.city against FFP_TAX.cities[country] (hid ALL meetups when taxonomy unhydrated or city missing from list). Now matches on m.country directly. (b) FIX day-streak: daysAgo now CALENDAR-day diff (was elapsed-hours → same day split into 2 buckets); streak no longer resets when today isn't logged yet (today-grace). **NEW: FFP-ISSUES-LOG.md** — running record of prod bugs + root cause + fix; review before changing shared surfaces.
  - v270: REAL FIX for passport card HUGE on refresh — root cause was prerenderPassportShare() (the iOS share pre-render, added v256) setting the LIVE .pass-shell transform to 'none' for the html2canvas capture → on-screen card flashed full 540px for 1-3s on every panel-show/load. Now renders an OFFSCREEN CLONE; visible card never touched. (v269's ResizeObserver re-scale kept as backup.) Plus Connections panel: My Collection card DARK GREEN; create-quest + collection modals padded (.cv-wrap/.qcreate); host-CTA card replaced with a single full-width yellow "Post a Meetup" button.
  - v269: (a) FIX passport card huge-on-refresh — scalePassportCard ran on fixed timeouts before layout settled (measured container too wide); now a ResizeObserver re-scales when the container reaches its real width (+ double-rAF, 0-width guard). (b) CONNECTIONS panel redesign: two entry cards **Matches** (People you might click with) + **My Collection (N)** (new CollectionView modal — lists collected passports from member_connections_list, tagged Connected/Added, tap → openMemberDetail), Post-a-Meetup CTA stays standalone below. collection-count badge updated in loadConnectionsCount.
  - v268 + DB: passport stat fixes. **Connections** (was 0): member_connections_count/list now use COLLECTION semantics — `(requester=me, not rejected) OR (addressee=me AND accepted)` — so it grows when you add someone (was accepted-only). DB-ONLY (RPCs live now, no deploy needed). **Meets** (was always 0): the /api/members/:id/meetups-attended endpoint loadMeets() fetched NEVER EXISTED → built `member_meets(p_me)` RPC (a Meet = completed [meets_at<now] + not cancelled + >=2 people [host + joined] + you hosted/joined); loadMeets() now calls it (needs dashboard deploy). Verified: Grant conns 3, meets 0 (no qualifying meet yet); synthetic completed 2-person meet → both host+joiner get +1.
  - v267 + meet-move loader **v22** (ref ?v=22): FIX Who's-going host/attendee passports invisible to NON-ADMIN members. **Root cause:** members RLS = `(auth.uid()=id) OR is_admin()` (self/admin only); the loader fetched host+attendee profiles via direct `from('members').select` → regular members got nothing (admins saw everyone, masking it). Now via new **members_cards(p_ids uuid[])** SECURITY DEFINER RPC (public passport fields only — no email/phone/dob; mirrors get_match_pool). Verified RPC returns host+attendee with photos. ⚠️ Other direct member fetches by non-admins would have the same RLS issue — watch for it.
  - v266: FIX (§3c resolved) Who's-going OWN passport card showed no details. FFPCard.resolve routed self → fromProfile() and discarded the loader-fetched attendee row, so an un-hydrated MemberProfile.data blanked the card. resolve now MERGES (prefers profile/cache non-empty fields, falls back to the passed row) via FFPCard._merge — no card renders blank when data exists anywhere. Reconciles the who's-going count too (own card renders → 2/8). Dashboard-only. Verified blank-profile self-resolve now returns real data.
  - v265: Meet & Move Discover hides PAST meetups (filters MeetMove.filtered() discover branch on m._ts >= now-3h grace; Discover had no date check so open meetups lingered forever). Dashboard-only. Follow-up: daily cron to mark past 'open' meetups 'ended' + populate the empty Past tab. · assets/ffp-earnings-loader.js **v18** (lazy ref ?v=18) · assets/ffp-feedback-widget.js **v5** (member+provider ref ?v=5)
  - v263: FIX passport-holder PHOTO missing on matches deck + who's-going. ROOT CAUSE (not patchwork): FFPPassportCard.frontShell (the ONE canonical card, used by both surfaces) built the photo div as `style='...url('...')...'` — single-quoted style attr + single-quoted url() → the quote after `url(` closed the attribute early so background-image never applied (any photo). Fixed by double-quoting the style attribute. Verified rendered HTML now contains the full image URL inside the attribute. Likely also helps §3c (who's-going own-card). ⚠️ FOLLOW-UP: photos are ~140KB base64 data: URLs in members.photo_url; get_match_pool ships them inline (80 rows → multi-MB; will fail at scale) — migrate to Supabase Storage + short public URLs.
  - v262 (P2b member-created quests UI): "Create your own quest" button + form (title/category/optional activity/country+city/target) → member_save_quest; quest detail join box (join count + Join → member_quest_join). Check-in loader v7 (ref bumped ?v=6→?v=7): after a verified check-in calls member_quest_progress_checkin to auto-advance joined quests + surfaces "explorer badge earned". Needs backend v70 (joined_count). DEPLOY together: member v262 + checkin loader v7 (Netlify) + backend v70 (Vercel). Verified end-to-end (engine + UI RPC payloads incl. rule_activity).
  - v261: quest detail shows provider's prize (prize_text) — pairs with backend v69 (member quest discovery endpoints) so the member Quests panel loads quests (incl. provider venue quests) for the FIRST time. v260: Challenges moved from bottom nav → avatar menu. v259: Log Activity duration is a SINGLE-TAP H/M/S wheel (window.FFPDurationPicker, reusable) — replaced v257's 3 number boxes per Grant ("single tap, platform standard, same across the platform"). Still stores duration_min + duration_sec.
  - ⚠️ DEPLOY PENDING (built 2026-06-04, push → Netlify): ffp-member-dashboard.html **v258** + assets/ffp-earnings-loader.js **v18**. Cumulative v255→v258: v255 passport-card share copy; v256 iOS share fix (pre-render image → instant navigator.share within user activation); v257 Log Activity duration = Hours/Minutes/Seconds inputs (was a clock picker; removed unused time-of-day field) + profile phone country-code picker full-bleed, UAE-first, defaults to +971; **v258 = #28 step 4** — earnings-loader **v18** (lazy ref bumped ?v=17→**?v=18**): 'quoted' payout row shows the admin's quote (local amount/net/fee/rate) + Accept (member_accept_payout) / Cancel (member_cancel_payout); both payout row renderers now share buildPayoutRow(). v257 also needs **backend index.js v68** (duration_sec in activity-logs) + the DB migration (already applied).
- ffp-admin-dashboard.html **v42** (lazy-loader cache-bust **v=47**; footer "build v42") · ffp-admin-payouts-loader.js **v9** · ffp-admin-referrals-loader.js **v4**
  - ⚠️ DEPLOY PENDING (built 2026-06-04, not yet pushed → Netlify): admin-dashboard **v42** + ffp-admin-payouts-loader.js **v9** (cache-bust **v=47**) = #28 step 3 payout QUOTE UI. The supporting RPCs were already live and were re-verified end-to-end this session (quote→quoted with fields set; reject→rejected + hold txn deleted; bad_status guard). Until pushed, the served admin build stays v41.
- assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js **v22** (lazy ref ?v=22) · ffp-provider-dashboard.html **v30** (feedback ref ?v=5) + **ffp-provider-quest-create-loader.js v1** (ref ?v=1)
  - v21 FIX (2026-06-04): member-hosted meetups never showed on the Meet & Move **Discover** tab. The mapped meetup carried `area: m.city` but NOT `city`; MeetMove.filtered() filters by `m.city`, and with the location filter defaulting to country=UAE, `cc.indexOf(undefined)` excluded EVERY meetup on Discover (host only saw their own via Hosting/Joined; "All countries" was an accidental workaround). Now maps `city`+`country`. Verified. Deploy: meet-move loader v21 + member dashboard v264 (ref ?v=21).
  - ⚠️ DEPLOY PENDING (built 2026-06-04 → Netlify): ffp-provider-dashboard.html **v30** + ffp-provider-quest-create-loader.js **v1** = #quests P1 provider create-quest UI ("Your quests" card at top of the Quests panel: create/edit/pause → provider_save_quest). DB already live + verified.
- backend index.js **v70** (⚠️ DEPLOY PENDING → Vercel; live is v67) + vercel.json (crons: sunday-summary, meetup-reminders). v70 = /api/quests + /api/quests/:id also return **joined_count** (member-quest social hook). v69 = **MEMBER QUEST DISCOVERY**: GET /api/quests + GET /api/quests/:id (never existed before; members saw NO quests). v68 = activity-logs returns duration_sec. v67 verified live.
- (stable, earlier) ffp-taxonomy.js v7, ffp-profile-complete.html v32, ffp-admin-auth.js v7, admin loaders, checkin loader v6, passport cover PNGs, public.foods.
- ENV required on Vercel: **SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET** (auth/RLS — §1), **CRON_SECRET** (crons). Sub-daily crons need Vercel Pro.
- LIVE DB (no deploy): notifications system (table + create_notification/member_notifications/seen-via members.notifs_seen_at), #2 handle_connection + #3 host_meetup notification triggers, admin_verify/invalidate/leaderboard referral RPCs, payout workflow RPCs (admin_quote_payout / member_accept_payout / member_cancel_payout / admin_reject_payout) + payouts schema (§1d). USD-only wallet (§1c). **NEW 2026-06-04:** activity_logs.duration_sec (smallint 0-59) + log_activity RPC now 9-arg (added p_duration_sec; old 8-arg dropped) — Log Activity stores H/M/S; verified (90min/45s) then cleaned.
- **PROVIDER QUESTS P1 — DB LIVE (2026-06-04):** `quests` + `provider_id`, `owner_type` (default 'admin'), `prize_text`; quest `scope` check now allows **'venue'**. New RPC **`provider_save_quest(p_provider, p_id, p jsonb)`** (SECURITY DEFINER, trusts p_provider like provider_save_listing, granted anon+authenticated): creates a venue stamp (stamps = name+icon+color; default icon 'storefront', color '#2BA8E0'), inserts the quest (scope='venue', owner_type='provider', status='live' = quick-launch, require_distinct_venues=false, target_count 1-50, category lowercased to the allowed set fitness/sports/wellness/recovery/adventure/food), links it via `quest_venues`. Completion unchanged: member_quest_submit → provider_quest_approve → member_stamps. **Verified end-to-end live** (create→submit→approve→stamp awarded + progress 'completed') then cleaned. ✅ **Provider create-quest UI BUILT** (ffp-provider-quest-create-loader.js v1 + provider dashboard v30, deploy pending): "Your quests" card at top of #panel-quests with Create/Edit/Pause; create→live, pause='draft', remove='ended'. Verified RPC edit + pause + stamp-name sync + wrong-provider→null. ✅ **Member discovery DONE** (backend v69 /api/quests + /api/quests/:id; member v261 shows prize_text). ✅ **QR→signup→join at venue: ALREADY WIRED (verified 2026-06-04, no build needed)** — `venue_active_programs(p_provider)` already returns the provider's live quests via quest_venues, so scanning the venue QR shows a "Quest" button → member_quest_submit; the dashboard head-script stashes ?venue= → login.html signup → returns to dashboard → checkin boot() resumes the venue. Provider quests flow through this automatically. ✅ **P2 member-quest ENGINE — DB LIVE + verified (2026-06-04):** quests + `visibility`, `eligibility` ('venues'|'rule'), `rule_activity`. RPCs (SECURITY DEFINER, anon+authenticated): **`member_save_quest(p_me,p_id,p)`** (rule-based exploration quest: owner_type='member', scope='city', eligibility='rule', require_distinct_venues=true, creates an EXPLORER stamp [icon 'explore', color '#a855f7'], creator auto-joins); **`member_quest_join(p_me,p_quest)`** (progress row + returns join count); **`member_quest_progress_checkin(p_me,p_provider)`** (auto-counts the member's joined rule-quests on a VERIFIED venue check-in — match = city + optional rule_activity in providers.activities, country lenient when provider.country null; distinct venues via quest_checkins; awards badge at target — NO provider approval). Verified end-to-end (create→2 distinct check-ins→badge; dup check-in idempotent; join count=2) then cleaned. ⬜ NEXT (P2b): member UI — "Create a quest" form (activity+city rule) + Join button + join counts + my-quests; hook member_quest_progress_checkin into the check-in loader after a verified check-in; surface join count in /api/quests. Optional: venue-aware welcome on signup screen.
- ⬜ REMAINING: #28 — ✅ step 3 admin quote+reject UI BUILT; ✅ step 4 member Accept/Cancel UI BUILT (both deploy-pending, above); ⬜ step 5 the 4 payout emails (request confirm, quote→member, completed, cancelled/refunded) (§1d). Plus: broadcast email-send + audience targeting; #3 sport/city match-filter; rank-up notifications.
- 📄 See **FFP-DEV-RETROSPECTIVE.md** — root-cause analysis of recurring mistakes + the correct-build playbook/checklist (read before making changes).

KEY LIVE THIS SESSION (2026-06-03→04): mintSupabaseJwt → signin/onboard return a real Supabase JWT so auth.uid() resolves (§1, fixed admin + member RLS). USD-ONLY wallet — transactions/referrals/payouts/members/content_submissions `*_aed` columns now HOLD USD (values converted once; no peg/conversion in code anywhere; §1c). Referral AUTO-credit on paid signup = **tier% × actual amount paid** (Stripe amount_total, after discount), not list price; admin Referrals = record + Invalid clawback. RPCs live: admin_verify_referral, admin_invalidate_referral, admin_referral_leaderboard. Meet & Move emails (confirm/cancel event-driven, reminder cron; meetup_attendees.reminder_sent_at). Grant = members.role super_admin + admin_users row.

### 🔧 NEW BUILD QUEUE — Grant 2026-06-04 (RULES: deep structure check + ALL related files FIRST; no guessing; work from CURRENT LIVE files; NO patching — rewrite correctly)
1. **Feedback widget not opening (member dashboard)** — ffp-feedback-widget.js v4; window.FFPFeedback.open() invoked by topbar button. Find the real cause (build() defines FFPFeedback at its END — anything throwing earlier leaves it undefined → silent no-op). Fix at root.
2. **Notify holder when someone adds their passport to a collection** — NOTE: no "passport collection" table/feature exists yet (verified) — scope the collect feature OR clarify what "collection" means before building the notification.
3. **Notify followers/connections when a holder posts a MATCHING meet-up** — connections exist (handle_connection, member_connections_list); no "followers" table — confirm followers == connections. Match = same sport/city/etc.
4. **Admin Broadcast Center** — compose + send email AND in-app notification to targeted audience (status/tier/city/active). (= tasks #29 notifications-system, #30 broadcast.)
PROGRESS 2026-06-04: ✅ Step 1 backend notif endpoints (index.js **v65**: GET /api/notifications, POST /seen, POST /api/admin/broadcast; members.notifs_seen_at col). ✅ #2 handle_connection notifies the holder ("X added your passport"). ✅ #3 host_meetup notifies followers ("X is hosting…"). All LIVE on Supabase + verified with real records then cleaned. ✅ #4 admin Broadcast Center built — ffp-admin-dashboard **v40** (new "Broadcast" sidebar item + panel-broadcast → AdminBroadcast.send() → POST /api/admin/broadcast). NOTIFICATIONS FEATURE SET COMPLETE (in-app). ⚠️ DEPLOY: index.js **v65** → Vercel (endpoints; bell + broadcast need it) and ffp-admin-dashboard.html **v40** → Netlify. Remaining future: email send + audience targeting on broadcast; sport/city match-filter on #3; rank-up notifications.

NOTIFICATIONS — ACCURATE STRUCTURE (checked 2026-06-04, corrects an earlier wrong "no system" note):
- `public.notifications` TABLE EXISTS: id, audience (default 'all'), member_id (NULL = broadcast to everyone), title, body, icon (default 'campaign'), link, created_at. RLS: read where member_id=auth.uid() OR member_id IS NULL OR is_admin(); admin write (is_admin). **No read_at / type / data columns.**
- MEMBER BELL UI EXISTS (ffp-member-dashboard ~line 7695-7771): fetches `FFP_API_NOTIF (=ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app)/api/notifications` (expects {notifications:[], unread:N}) + POSTs `/api/notifications/seen`. Renders icon/title/body/time + a badge. Also merges in-app review prompts.
- **GAP: backend index.js (v64) has NO /api/notifications or /seen route** → the bell's fetch 404s (caught) → only review prompts show. So the system is HALF-built: table + bell exist, backend endpoints missing, and nothing inserts targeted rows.
- FOLLOW model = "Add passport" in Matches deck → `handle_connection` RPC (persists the connection). connectViaRpc already TOASTS "you'll be notified when they host a meet & move" — promise currently undelivered.
BUILD PLAN (proper, in order): (1) backend GET /api/notifications?member_id (broadcast + targeted + unread via a members.notifs_seen_at or per-member seen) + POST /api/notifications/seen + POST /api/admin/broadcast; add read/seen tracking column. (2) #2 — handle_connection inserts a targeted notification to the added member ("X added your passport"). (3) #3 — host_meetup inserts targeted notifications to the host's followers/connections on a matching meet-up. (4) #2-future — rank-up notifications. (5) #4 — admin Broadcast Center UI → /api/admin/broadcast (in-app row + optional email to audience). (6) passport "collection" = the existing follow; no new table needed unless a separate favourites list is wanted.

PROVIDER REVIEW → PROVIDER RANKINGS — ✅ BUILT 2026-06-03 (see full spec §6v):
✅ DECISIONS CONFIRMED by Grant ("go with your rec"): 1(a) IN-APP card on next visit for check-ins >1h old & unreviewed (no email/cron); 2(a) Overall + Experience + Service + Facilities stars + comment (Overall drives ranking); 3 ALL three surfaces — provider dashboard, member-facing discovery (public stars + sort by rating), admin leaderboard.
✅ DONE: table public.provider_reviews (LIVE). All 5 RPCs LIVE + tested: submit_provider_review, member_pending_reviews, provider_rating, provider_reviews_list, provider_rankings (admin, now also returns category). Member UI (v236): prompt card + star modal. Provider UI (v28): "Your rating" block. Admin UI (v31): Provider Rankings leaderboard tab + Country/City/Category filters.
⬜ STILL TODO (Grant, 2026-06-03): MEMBER-FACING DISCOVERY (public stars + sort by rating) — DEFERRED: there is no member-facing provider directory in the app yet, so there's nothing to attach public stars to. provider_rating() is live + public + ready to plug in once that surface is designed. (Grant: "more thought needs to go into how providers are discoverable… a to-do later.") Possible future: show a provider their RANK vs others inside the provider dashboard (would need to expose a non-admin ranking RPC).
--- original spec ---
Spec (Grant): ~1 hour after a member checks in to a facility, they get a "review your session" prompt — rate out of 5 stars across Experience, Service, Facilities, plus a comment. Reviews feed PROVIDER RANKINGS.
OPEN QUESTIONS to confirm before building (the AskUserQuestion tool kept failing — ask in plain text):
  1. Prompt delivery: (a) in-app card on next visit for check-ins >1h old & unreviewed [recommended, no new infra]; (b) email ~1h after [needs email+cron pipeline]; (c) both.
  2. Rating fields: (a) Overall + Experience/Service/Facilities stars + comment [matches spec]; (b) 3 categories only, Overall = their average; (c) single overall star + comment.
  3. Where ratings/rankings show (multi): provider dashboard (own rating + comments); member-facing discovery (public stars + sort by rating); admin leaderboard (ranking table + moderate).
Likely build once decided: new `provider_reviews` table (member_id, provider_id, activity_log_id, stars_overall/experience/service/facilities, comment, created_at) + submit RPC + "pending reviews" RPC (check-ins ≥1h old w/o review) + member prompt UI + provider/admin rating displays. Tie rating to a real check-in (activity_logs row) to keep reviews honest.


## ⚠️ 0-CRITICAL — TOOL TRAP THAT CAUSED THE "works then breaks" LOOP (2026-06-01)
The Edit/Write/Read FILE TOOLS and the bash shell see DIFFERENT copies of workspace files. **The file that actually persists + deploys is the one the FILE TOOLS write.** A bash `python open(w)` write or `node --check` runs on a SEPARATE sandbox copy and can show "OK" while the real file is unchanged/broken — this is why repairs seemed to land then "break."
RULE: edit workspace files ONLY with Edit/Write; verify by re-reading with the Read tool. Use bash `node --check` only as a secondary signal, never as the source of truth. (Confirmed: events loader was COMPLETE via Read tool while bash showed it truncated.)
- 2026-06-01 reconfirmed: bash's mount serves a TRUNCATED copy of the larger provider loaders (e.g. challenges loader cut at ~line 358 mid-statement) even though the canonical file-tool/Read view is complete & ends with `})();`. So `node --check` via bash is UNRELIABLE for ffp-provider-*-loader.js — validate their structure by reading the head + tail with the Read tool instead. The Read/Write view is what the user deploys.

### LIVE DB FIXES (no upload needed)
- 2026-06-01: `activity_types` RLS only allowed `authenticated`; provider session reads as `anon` → activity picker empty ("No matches", 379 placeholder). FIXED: added policy `activity_types_anon_read` (SELECT TO anon USING active=true). anon now sees 379. Provider New-event activity picker works on reload.
- 2026-06-01: EVENTS NOT SAVING root cause (from postgres logs): `events_fitness_level_check` only allowed Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Elite/Professional/All, but the form sends FFP taxonomy levels (Not Tried/Social/Competitive/Representative/Professional) → 400 on provider_save_listing. FIXED: widened the check to accept BOTH vocabularies + NULL. Verified insert with 'Social' succeeds. (LEVEL VOCAB still split 3 ways across forms — to unify in the rebuild.) Also seen in logs: `column providers.passport_no does not exist` — some provider query selects a non-existent column (separate console error, investigate later).

## 0. OPERATING PROTOCOL (every change)
0. **UNDERSTAND THE FULL STRUCTURE BEFORE FIXING (Grant, 2026-06-03).** Before touching anything, map the WHOLE chain for the feature: the dashboard HTML + EVERY loader it pulls (panels are loaded by separate `assets/ffp-*-loader.js` files — a panel can look "empty" because of its loader, not the HTML) + the backend route + the RPC/RLS + the auth/JWT path end-to-end. When two+ things show "no data," find the ONE shared invariant first (e.g. "does `auth.uid()` actually resolve in the browser?") instead of patching each symptom. Do NOT trust code comments that assert something works — verify the runtime contract (e.g. that signin actually returns a `jwt`). The v57 auth bug + multi-round earnings/admin debug happened because symptoms were patched before the shared root cause (no JWT issued → auth.uid() null) was found. (See §1.)
1. READ the real file before editing. 2. CROSS-REFERENCE the loader(s) for any panel touched. 3. VERIFY, don't claim (read code / query DB / `node --check`). 4. No blind patching. 5. Validate: extract inline JS → `node --check`; 0 NUL bytes; unique string match on edits. 6. Deploy: present file + bump the version stamp; large files UPLOAD, never paste (paste truncates). 7. State the checks done in each reply.

### 0a-1. FFPPicker is now DASHBOARD-OWNED (decoupled, 2026-06-01)
The activity/country/city picker (`window.FFPPicker`) is defined in an inline `<script>` in ffp-provider-dashboard.html (build v25, before the loader script tags). Events + Challenges activity pickers use it and NO LONGER depend on the experiences loader being deployed/correct. The experiences loader still defines its own FFPPicker (harmless redundant overwrite when it's the correct file). Dashboard deploys reliably → activity picker always works. (Was the cause of repeated "Activity picker not ready".)

### 0a. THE REUSE RULE (confirmed by Grant 2026-06-01 — keep as protocol)
If a similar component already WORKS somewhere, rebuild the broken one on that exact same system — do NOT patch the broken one with parallel/legacy code or media-query hacks. Same modal mechanics, same classes, same render path.
- Win: Log Activity modal was full-screen-broken on the legacy `.modal` + media-query patch. Rebuilt on Post-a-Meetup's `.detail-backdrop`/`.detail-modal`/`.pm-form` system (shared `#…-backdrop` full-screen rule) → worked first try (v207).
- Corollary: render content as a BUILT-IN part of the component, not injected cross-file via setTimeout (fragile, silently vanishes). E.g. "Who's going" moved from a loader setTimeout-injection to an inline section in the modal body (v208).

### 0b. MEET & MOVE — "Who's going" MUST always show the HOST, listed FIRST (committed per Grant, repeatedly)
The meetup detail modal's "Who's going" list ALWAYS includes the host as the first person, so members can see everyone attending. Do not let this depend on the loader having put the host into `m.attendees`. `MeetMove.whosGoingInline(m)` guarantees it: if no entry has `isHost`, it prepends a host entry built from the meetup's own fields (`m.host`, `m.host_member_id`, etc.); if a host entry exists but isn't first, it's moved to first. Host badged "HOST". (v209)

## 1. THE auth.uid() TRAP — ROOT CAUSE FOUND + FIXED (backend v57, 2026-06-03)
**The real story (corrected — earlier notes here were WRONG and cost a multi-round debug):**
`auth.uid()` did **not** resolve client-side for ANYONE — members, providers, OR admins — because **the backend never sent the client a JWT.** `/api/auth/signin` returned `{token, member}` with **no `jwt` field**, so `ffp-api-integration.js` (which only applies a session `if (res.jwt)`) left `window.supabase` running as pure **anon** for every user. The `ffp_jwt`/`applySupabaseSession()` machinery was fully built on the client but the server half was never finished. Several files *asserted* the JWT was applied (api-integration "Supabase-compatible HS256 JWT for RLS auth.uid()"; earnings loader v11 "client already carries the JWT") — those comments were aspirational, not true. The honest signal was the feedback widget's SECURITY DEFINER workaround ("custom-JWT members don't resolve auth.uid()").
- Symptom: any `supabase.from(x)` read/insert/update/delete gated by RLS like `(... = auth.uid())` silently returns/affects **0 rows, no error**. This is why **admin dashboard panels AND the member earnings panel** (balance/transactions/referrals/payouts, all RLS table reads) were blank — same single root cause.
- §6p was "verified" only by manually `set_config`'ing `request.jwt.claims` in a SQL test — that simulated the claim, it never proved the *browser* sends a valid JWT. Don't verify a runtime contract with a SQL simulation.

**THE FIX (v57):** `/api/auth/signin` and `/api/onboard/from-stripe` now return `jwt: mintSupabaseJwt(member)` — a real HS256 token signed with the project JWT secret (`sub=member.id`, `role`/`aud`='authenticated', 30-day exp). The anon key is HS256, so the project validates HS256 against the legacy JWT secret → `auth.uid()` now resolves to `member.id` in RLS for everyone. **Requires Vercel env `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`** (Supabase → Settings → API → JWT Secret). Missing env → `mintSupabaseJwt()` returns null = safe no-op. After deploy, users must do a clean sign-out + sign-in to mint the token. **Verified live: admin dashboard populated 2026-06-03.**
- ADMIN identity must align: the member's `id` must exist in `admin_users` AND `members.role` ∈ admin/super_admin. (Grant: members.role='super_admin' + admin_users row added 2026-06-03.) `is_admin()` = `exists(admin_users where id=auth.uid())`.
- **FIX PATTERN (still valid for anon-safe RPCs):** a SECURITY DEFINER RPC taking the id explicitly (member id from `FFPAuth.getMember().id`, provider id from `FFP_PROVIDER.id`), `GRANT EXECUTE TO anon, authenticated`. Now that auth.uid() resolves, new code can rely on RLS directly, but the RPC pattern remains the most robust.

### RPCs live in DB
Member: `get_match_pool(p_me)`, `handle_connection`, `log_activity`, `host_meetup`, `join_meetup`, `rsvp_event`, `apply_experience`, `submit_feedback`.
Provider: `provider_delete_listing(p_kind,p_provider,p_id)` — delete confirmed working.

## 1c. REFERRAL + EARNINGS MODEL — LOCKED (Grant, 2026-06-03)
- **Currency:** the PLATFORM displays in **USD** everywhere (balance, earnings log, referral rewards, admin reward column, payout minimum). Stored money columns are still `*_aed`; convert at the boundary (aedToUsd for display, usdToAed when writing). ONLY payouts are shown/disbursed in the member's **local currency** (AED for UAE) — the payout list/records stay AED. Peg 3.6725.
- **Referral crediting = AUTOMATED, not admin-gated** (Grant: "I want things automated, not waiting for admin"). On a CONFIRMED paid signup via a referral link, backend `/api/onboard/from-stripe` (v61) sets the referral `paid`, inserts an `in` wallet transaction (category 'referrals', status 'paid'), and emails the holder "new referral — +$X added — balance $Y · payout at $250". Reward = tier% (5/10/20) × $99 membership.
- **Balance** = sum(`in`.paid) − sum(`out` in paid/pending). Payout writes an `out` row on execution. Min payout **$250 USD**.
- **Admin Referrals panel** = a record + an **Invalid (claw back)** action (`admin_invalidate_referral` removes the credit). `admin_verify_referral` still exists for any edge 'pending' row but the normal path is auto-credit. (History: v59 auto-credited but I'd NOT checked the admin verify panel first; v60 reverted to admin-gated; v61 = automated per Grant's decision — this is the final model.)
- RPCs live: `admin_verify_referral(p_admin,p_referral)`, `admin_invalidate_referral(p_admin,p_referral)` (SECURITY DEFINER, admin-gated, granted anon+authenticated).
- Deploy set (2026-06-03 late): backend **index.js v61** (Vercel; needs `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` env — see §1), **ffp-member-dashboard.html v246**, **assets/ffp-earnings-loader.js v14** (lazy ref ?v=14), **ffp-admin-dashboard.html v39** (footer build v39), **ffp-admin-referrals-loader.js v2**, backend **index.js v58** Sunday Summary dark rebuild (same file).

## 1d. PAYOUT WORKFLOW (#28) — request→quote→accept/cancel (2026-06-04)
Model (USD platform): member REQUESTS (existing submitPayout: payouts row 'pending' + an 'out'/'pending' transaction = the balance HOLD) → ADMIN quotes bank rate+fee (`admin_quote_payout` → status 'quoted', sets local_currency/local_amount/bank_rate/fee_usd/net_usd) → MEMBER accepts (`member_accept_payout` → 'paid', hold txn → 'paid') OR cancels (`member_cancel_payout` → 'cancelled', DELETES the hold txn = balance returns); ADMIN can `admin_reject_payout` (releases hold). All 4 RPCs SECURITY DEFINER, granted anon+authenticated, LIVE + tested (quote+cancel verified, balance restored).
- payouts schema added: local_currency, local_amount, bank_rate, fee_usd, net_usd, quoted_at, accepted_at, cancelled_at. status check now allows pending/quoted/approved/paid/rejected/cancelled. amount_aed CHECK fixed >=500 (was AED-era, read as $500) → **>=250** (USD min).
- ✅ DONE: step 1 schema, step 2 RPCs, **step 3 admin quote+reject UI** (ffp-admin-payouts-loader.js v9 + admin-dashboard v42, deploy pending). Step-3 build: Payouts panel pending row action is now **Quote** (modal: local currency [default AED], bank rate [1 USD =], fee USD, auto-computed/editable local amount, live preview) → `admin_quote_payout` → status 'quoted'; new **Quoted** tab (shows local amount + "awaiting member"); **Reject** now calls `admin_reject_payout` (server-side deletes the 'out' hold txn = balance returns) and stores the member-facing reason; view modal shows a Quote details block + Re-quote. Amounts shown in USD ($) — corrected stale "AED" modal labels (the `.aed` CSS class already renders $). p_admin = window.FFP_ADMIN.id. Legacy approve→Mark-Paid path kept for any pre-existing 'approved' rows. ✅ **step 4 member Accept/Cancel UI** (earnings-loader v18, deploy pending): 'quoted' payout row shows the quote + Accept (member_accept_payout → paid, hold txn → paid) / Cancel (member_cancel_payout → cancelled, hold txn deleted = balance returns). Verified end-to-end live this session (accept→paid + txn paid; cancel→cancelled + txn deleted) then cleaned. ⬜ REMAINING: step 5 emails (requested confirm, quoted→member, completed, cancelled/refunded).

## 2. DEPLOY FACTS
Host: Netlify (ffppassport.com) ← github.com/grant2223/ffp-passport (`main`, auto-publish). Backend: Express on ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app. DB: Supabase `kxzyuofecmtymablnmak`.
Served pages: `ffp-member-dashboard.html`, `ffp-provider-dashboard.html`, `ffp-admin-dashboard.html`, login / profile-complete / apply; loaders in repo root + `assets/`.
- Provider dashboard has a bottom-left build stamp (`FFP build vNN`) to confirm a deploy landed; member uses a version comment at the top of the file.
- Admin dashboard: the sidebar FOOTER shows a VISIBLE build stamp (`build vNN · FFP Admin`, line ~1396). It was hardcoded "v1.0" forever (never updated) → confusing. As of v32 it tracks the real version. **MUST bump this footer string in lockstep with the top version comment on every admin change** so the on-screen version matches the deployed file.
- The download/copy sync can corrupt files in the workspace (NUL-padding + truncation); GitHub itself is clean. Trust GitHub + DB + browser console over raw local reads; `node --check` before trusting/deploying any JS.
### ⚠️ WORKSPACE FILE INTEGRITY MAP (full sweep 2026-06-01 via `node --check` on every JS + every HTML inline script)
The download/copy sync TRUNCATED 10 loader files in this workspace (they end mid-statement). LIVE/GitHub copies are complete (live dashboards work). DO NOT upload any file in the CORRUPT list from the workspace — re-pull it clean from GitHub first, then edit + `node --check`.

CLEAN (valid, safe to edit/ship): ALL 15 HTML pages (member/provider/admin dashboards, login, apply, profile-complete, my-passport, etc.); ALL `assets/*.js` (incl. ffp-meet-move-loader.js, ffp-taxonomy.js, ffp-api-integration.js, ffp-realtime.js, all member loaders); and root JS: ffp-admin-{auth,analytics,content,deals,feedback,meetups,members,overview,quests,referrals}-loader.js, ffp-provider-{auth,deals,notifications,profile,quests,venue-qr}-loader.js, ffp-member-quest-scan-loader.js.

RECOVERED + REPAIRED from session transcript (now COMPLETE + valid + RPC-wired, safe to ship) 2026-06-01:
- ffp-provider-events-loader.js (403 lines), ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js (800), ffp-provider-challenges-loader.js (379) — truncated tails restored with EXACT transcript bytes (verified every tail identifier is defined in the head); all node --check OK, provider_save_listing ×2 + provider_delete_listing ×1 each.

STILL CORRUPT — TRUNCATED (7 files; recover same way from transcript if needed — NOT blocking provider onboarding):
- ffp-provider-checkins-loader.js
- ffp-admin-applications-loader.js, ffp-admin-challenges-loader.js, ffp-admin-events-loader.js, ffp-admin-experiences-loader.js, ffp-admin-payouts-loader.js, ffp-admin-providers-loader.js

RECOVERY METHOD (use this, don't ask Grant to re-pull): the full session transcript .jsonl under `.claude/projects/.../<id>.jsonl` contains every file's intact content from earlier turns. Extract the authoritative tail/file, verify referenced identifiers exist in the head, splice, `node --check`.

CORRECTION: I earlier wrongly flagged `assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js` as pre-corrupted — that failure was from MY edits; after reverting, it passes node --check. It is CLEAN.

### 0c. ONE passport-card resolver — window.FFPCard (member dashboard, v211)
Single canonical card data resolver keyed by member id (members.id uuid). `FFPCard.mapRow(row)` = the ONE snake/camel-tolerant mapper; `.register(row)` feeds a cache; `.resolve(idOrObj)` returns the card object (self → MemberProfile.data, minus DOB). Data sources register (get_match_pool rows do; the meet-move loader SHOULD once it's de-corrupted). Renderers (Who's going) resolve by id — no surface hand-builds its own member object. Card NATIONALITY reads m.nationality (falls back to country). Still to route through it later: matches deck custom markup + the static own-passport mappers + loader registration.

## 3. STATUS BOARD

### 3a. Live versions  (snapshot 2026-06-01, late session)
| File | Live | Local ahead? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ffp-member-dashboard.html | ~v202–v206 (Grant deploying iteratively) | **v212 (local, NOT fully confirmed live)** | v203 full-screen modals + top banner; v204 log date/time overlap; v205 meetup-modal-open fix; v206 min-height:100vh full-screen; v207 Log Activity rebuilt on detail-backdrop system; v208–209 Who's going host-first; v210 real passport details; v211 FFPCard resolver; v212 Who's going CAROUSEL + Level/Gender/Capacity one line |
| ffp-provider-dashboard.html | v23 | v23 | delete via RPC + top banner — LIVE (delete confirmed) |
| ffp-provider-{events,experiences,challenges}-loader.js | RPC delete LIVE | **edit/create being wired to provider_save_listing RPC NOW** | |
| assets/ffp-meet-move-loader.js | v16 (live, works) | ⚠️ workspace copy CORRUPTED — DO NOT upload (see §2) | |
| ffp-admin-dashboard.html | — | — | still corner toast (banner not applied) |

### 3b. Deploy queue (changed locally, awaiting upload)
- **ffp-member-dashboard.html v212** — UPLOAD (~1.7MB, don't paste). Cumulative v203→v212: full-screen modals + top banner; Log Activity rebuilt on the Post-a-Meetup `.detail-backdrop` modal system (Activity top, profile-default city, native date/time, 3-col duration); Post-a-Meetup form fixes; FFPCard resolver (§0c); Who's going = host-first CAROUSEL with ‹ › arrows; meetup Details on one line.
- (Pending) provider loaders + dashboard once `provider_save_listing` is wired (see §5).

### 3c. PARKED (revisit later, per Grant)
- **Who's going — the member's OWN passport card still not displaying correctly** even after v210–v212 (resolver + carousel + host-first + self-from-MemberProfile). Grant said park it and move on. Likely needs live debugging of FFPCard.fromProfile output / MemberProfile.data hydration timing on the live build. Resume after providers are onboarded.

### 3d. Broken / known issues (root cause)
- **Provider EDIT + CREATE listings** — auth.uid trap → silent 0-row update/insert. FIX IN PROGRESS via `provider_save_listing` RPC (§5).
- **Quests loader 404 flood** — `/api/quests/provider/<id>/checkins` backend route missing.
- **Member payouts + fitness/calorie writes** — same auth.uid trap → need RPCs.
- **Admin notifications** — still corner toast.

### 3e. Next up (priority order)
1. **Provider edit + create RPC (`provider_save_listing`)** — IN PROGRESS (unblocks onboarding providers for real-world testing). ← ACTIVE NOW
2. Deploy member v212 (upload) + commit FFP-MASTER.md to GitHub.
3. Un-park Who's going own-card; admin top-banner; quests-404 route; member payouts/fitness RPCs.

## 5. PROVIDER edit/create fix — `provider_save_listing` (build spec, 2026-06-01)
Root cause: each provider loader does `supabase.from(table).update(payload).eq('id',id)` and `.insert(payload)` directly → RLS auth.uid trap → silent 0 rows. Same fix as delete: SECURITY DEFINER RPC.
- Save call sites: events-loader L311(update)/318(insert); experiences-loader L705/713; challenges-loader L297/306. Provider id = `window.FFP_PROVIDER.id`. id present = edit; absent = create (status 'pending').
- Payload columns (exact, per loader):
  - events: title, description, about, activity, category, fitness_level, starts_at(tstz, NOT NULL), venue, city, area, setting, capacity(int), cost, parking, facilities, bring, hero_image_url.
  - experiences: title, description, overview, activity, category, exp_type, fitness_level, starts_at(date), ends_at(date), duration_days(int), country, destination, price_aed(numeric), capacity(int), what_included, what_not_included, accommodation, flights_info, travel_reqs, fitness_reqs, itinerary(jsonb), hero_image_url. (+featured=false on insert)
  - challenges: title, description, activity, category, metric, venue, prize_description, starts_at(tstz), ends_at(tstz), hero_image_url. (+challenge_type='provider', featured=false on insert)
- RPC: `provider_save_listing(p_kind text, p_provider uuid, p_id uuid, p jsonb) RETURNS uuid` — insert when p_id null (sets provider_id, status='pending'); else UPDATE ... WHERE id=p_id AND provider_id=p_provider; RETURNS the row id (NULL = not found / not permitted / unknown kind). GRANT EXECUTE anon, authenticated. Same trust model as provider_delete_listing (trusts client-supplied p_provider).
- ✅ RPC `provider_save_listing` is LIVE + TESTED in DB (insert ✓, update ✓, wrong-provider returns NULL ✓; UPDATE only touches keys present in payload via `p ? 'key'` so partial payloads don't wipe). No deploy needed for the RPC.
- ✅ Loader wiring DONE 2026-06-01: events/experiences/challenges loaders recovered from transcript + wired to provider_save_listing (save) — complete, node --check OK, ready to UPLOAD. Provider create + edit now functional end-to-end. Reference (the swap that was applied):
  - EDIT branch: replace `var upd = await supabase.from('<table>').update(payload).eq('id',id); if(upd.error) throw upd.error;` with `var upd = await supabase.rpc('provider_save_listing',{p_kind:'<kind>',p_provider:(window.FFP_PROVIDER||{}).id,p_id:id,p:payload}); if(upd.error) throw upd.error; if(!upd.data) throw new Error('Update failed — not found or not permitted');`
  - CREATE branch: delete the `payload.provider_id=...; payload.status='pending'; (payload.featured/challenge_type)` lines, and replace `var ins = await supabase.from('<table>').insert(payload).select().single(); if(ins.error) throw ins.error;` with `var ins = await supabase.rpc('provider_save_listing',{p_kind:'<kind>',p_provider:(window.FFP_PROVIDER||{}).id,p_id:null,p:payload}); if(ins.error) throw ins.error; if(!ins.data) throw new Error('Submit failed — please try again');`
  - kinds: events→'event', experiences→'experience', challenges→'challenge'. (RPC sets provider_id/status/challenge_type server-side.)

## 6e. ACTIVITY DATA LOSS — ROOT CAUSE + FIX (2026-06-02) — CRITICAL
SYMPTOM (Grant): "every time I update the members dashboard I lose my activity data." Data was NOT actually deleted (activity_logs is insert-only; deploys don't touch the DB; grant's saved logs were present). ROOT CAUSE: `saveLog()` pushed the entry to the map + toasted "Logged ✓" IMMEDIATELY (optimistic), THEN attempted the DB write only `if (member && member.id && window.supabase)` with errors swallowed to console. So if the member session wasn't ready (or the RPC errored), the activity was NEVER persisted but still appeared logged → it vanished on the next load/deploy = perceived data loss. FIX: saveLog now PERSISTS FIRST (await log_activity RPC), and only on success pushes to the map + shows success; if no session or the RPC errors, it shows a clear error and does NOT claim success / does NOT add to the map. An activity is only ever shown as logged if it reached activity_logs. (loadJourneyLogs already rebuilds the map from the DB on sign-in, so the displayed map = the DB.) DEPLOY ffp-member-dashboard.html. Same persist-then-confirm pattern already used by the venue check-in (FFPCheckin) + provider RPC saves.

## 6l. PASSPORT "YOUR JOURNEY" MAP → LEAFLET (2026-06-02) — Grant redesign
Replaced the hand-rolled SVG world map + Favorites/Wish List with a Leaflet map (dark CARTO tiles, CDN) on the member passport. window.JourneyMap (in the main dashboard script) does a World › Country › City drill-down: breadcrumb (#jm-crumb) + country/city chips (#jm-chips) + #ffp-jmap. World = a blue pin per active city (centroid via CITY_COORDS/estimateCityCoords), sized by count; tap a country chip → fits to country + its city pins; tap a city (pin or chip) → flies in + shows YELLOW pins at exact venue checkin_lat/lng (city centroid fallback if none). Selecting country/city sets state.selectedCountry/selectedCity → renderAll → the Top Activities / Top Venues / stats below all re-scope (getFilteredLogs now filters selectedCountry too). renderAll calls JourneyMap.render() (replaced renderCities()+renderMapPins()). Legacy setupMap()/loadWorldMap() early-return if #world-svg absent; add-city/city-search wiring guarded. Needs backend v53 (checkin_lat/lng added to /api/members/:id/activity-logs) for exact venue pins — without it, city scope shows the city centroid. node --check: both inline script blocks valid. SELECTION: Country + City dropdowns (#jm-country-sel/#jm-city-sel via JourneyMap._onCountry/_onCity) zoom in, plus tappable pins + breadcrumb. STYLING: tiles desaturated to neutral grey (#ffp-jmap .leaflet-tile{filter:grayscale(1) brightness(1.05) contrast(.92)}) — softer than CARTO's brown; map section is box-free (.jm-section, no card border) and FULL-BLEED on mobile (≤640px: .jm-map-wrap negative 20px margins = content padding, #ffp-jmap radius 0). DEPLOY: ffp-member-dashboard.html v220 (+ Leaflet CDN already in <head>) + backend index.js v53 (Vercel).

## 6i.1 FITNESS STATS — THE REAL BUG WAS READ-BACK, NOT SAVE (2026-06-02)
After many "not saving" reports: confirmed via SQL that records DO save (Grant's profile_meta: pr_bench_kg=90, squat 90, vo2 43, body_fat 14, resting_hr 48, weight 86, height 172, pr_dates all set). The save (member_profile_meta_save RPC from the CORE, v229) works. The bug: the Records tab READ profile_meta from a backend GET /api/members/:id/profile-meta endpoint that NEVER EXISTED in index.js (404) → FitnessStats.records stayed empty → "No record yet" even though the value was in the DB + showing on the leaderboard (which reads get_ranking_pool, a different working path). FIX: new SECURITY DEFINER RPC member_profile_meta_get(p_me) → to_json(profile_meta row); loader v18 reads via window.supabase.rpc('member_profile_meta_get') instead of the dead fetch. Verified anon-callable (returns bench 90). So save + read BOTH now on the proven RPC path, zero backend dependency. Also: whole "My PR" card is tappable (opens the full-screen editor), not just the small button. DEPLOY: ffp-member-dashboard.html v231 + assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js v18 (?v=19). RPC live.

## 6o.1 PHONE-QR CHECK-IN — RESUME AFTER LOGIN (2026-06-03)
Symptom (Grant): phone-camera QR scan → "asks for sign in, then doesn't go to the provider page." ROOT CAUSE: the provider QR encodes ffppassport.com/ffp-member-dashboard.html?venue=<id> (ffp-provider-venue-qr-loader.js). On an unauthenticated phone, ffp-api-integration.js autoInit redirects the member dashboard to login.html and DROPS the ?venue= query; login.html then returns to ffp-member-dashboard.html (no query) → checkin boot() finds no venue → nothing opens. FIX (no shared-file change): a tiny <head> script in ffp-member-dashboard.html (BEFORE all other scripts, so it beats the auth redirect) stashes ?venue=<id> → localStorage 'ffp_pending_venue'. ffp-member-checkin-loader.js v6 boot() now reads venue from the URL param OR the stash; if signed in → openContext()+clear; if not → keep stashed (resumes after login). Signed-in / in-app scans unchanged. DEPLOY: ffp-member-dashboard.html v233 (checkin ref ?v=6) + ffp-member-checkin-loader.js v6. Edge: non-members who scan then never sign up leave a harmless stale pending_venue; profile-incomplete members resume when they next reach the dashboard.

## 6o. CHECK-IN 2-HOUR PER-VENUE COOLDOWN (2026-06-03)
Prevents farming multiple quick check-ins at the SAME provider. Enforced SERVER-SIDE inside venue_checkin_activity (BOTH overloads — with/without p_calories): before inserting, `select max(logged_at) from activity_logs where member_id=p_me and provider_id=p_provider and logged_at > now()-interval '2 hours'`; if found, RETURNS json {blocked:true, minutes_left, venue, message} INSTEAD of inserting (no exception — so the client can show a friendly sheet). Window is PER-PROVIDER: a check-in at a DIFFERENT venue is unaffected (the natural reading of "check-in at a provider should have a 2 hour timeout"). ONE check-in path only: ffp-member-checkin-loader.js (v5, doSave honours {blocked}). Verified live: 1st call inserts, 2nd call returns blocked "2h 0m"; test rows cleaned up. DEPLOY: ffp-member-dashboard.html v232 (checkin ref ?v=5) + ffp-member-checkin-loader.js v5. RPC already live.
CLEANUP (2026-06-03): DELETED the orphan ffp-member-quest-scan-loader.js from the workspace folder — it was dead code (zero HTML references), superseded long ago by ffp-member-checkin-loader.js which handles QR camera + ?venue= link + activity list + GPS verify + quest/challenge/event sub-flows. ALL scans go through that single file. (Remove it from the GitHub repo on next push too if still present there.)

## 6p. ADMIN UNIFIED LOGIN — no more double login (2026-06-03)
ROOT CAUSE: login.html is a unified portal (member/provider/admin) that authenticates via the backend (/api/auth/signin → {token, member, jwt}) and redirects by role. But the admin DASHBOARD ran its OWN separate Supabase-Auth OTP gate (old ffp-admin-auth.js v4, signInWithOtp/verifyOtp) — a parallel auth system — so after logging in at /login the admin was forced to log in AGAIN. The provider gate was already converted to the lightweight pattern; admin never was.
FIX (clean, not patch): admin now rides the SAME session as members/providers.
  - admin's identity aligns: admin@findfitpeople.com has the SAME id (cc66c82c-f44e-4101-838f-30a25f36bc1e) in members(role=admin) AND admin_users AND auth.users. So the backend-minted JWT (sub=member.id) makes auth.uid()=cc66c82c and is_admin() returns TRUE (verified via set_config request.jwt.claims → is_admin()=true).
  - ffp-admin-dashboard.html now loads assets/ffp-api-integration.js (builds the Supabase client + applies the member JWT via Authorization header on autoInit) — REPLACING the old inline clean-anon-client block + the v25 decision to exclude it. That exclusion was only needed back when admin used a Supabase-Auth SESSION; now admin uses the same JWT-header bridge as everyone, so no conflict.
  - ffp-admin-auth.js REWRITTEN v7: tiny role gate mirroring ffp-provider-auth.js v5 — reads ffp_member from localStorage; no member → /login; role not admin/super → bounce to matching dashboard; else reveal + set window.FFP_ADMIN. NO OTP. Client gate is UX-only; real access enforced server-side by is_admin()+RLS on the JWT (tampered localStorage role can't read admin data without a valid admin JWT). ffpLogout now comes from ffp-api-integration (clear → login.html).
DEPLOY: ffp-admin-dashboard.html v23 + ffp-admin-auth.js v7 (+ ffp-api-integration.js already exists). Safety: gate always bounces to /login on failure (never a dead-end) — worst case = one login at /login, same as today.

## 6q. ADMIN ANALYTICS COUNTRY/CITY FILTER (2026-06-03)
Two dropdowns (Country, City) in the Analytics panel header (#analytics-country / #analytics-city) scope the WHOLE panel: KPIs (new/paid members, engagement), growth, tiers, demographics, categories, engagement chart, top providers, AND Community Health. members.city is the source of truth; there is NO country column — Country is DERIVED from the shared taxonomy window.FFP_TAX.cities (country→[cities]); members whose city isn't in the taxonomy bucket under "Other". Engagement/category/provider tables are scoped by the set of member-ids whose city matches (analytics loader now fetches member_id on activity_logs/claims/rsvps/meetup_attendees, referrer_id on referrals). Community Health scoped SERVER-SIDE: community_health_stats now takes p_cities text[] DEFAULT NULL (dropped the old zero-arg overload to avoid ambiguity); loader passes selectedCities() (city → [city]; country → all that country's member-cities; all → null/no arg). Revenue stays platform-wide (transactions carry no location). Selection persists across period/compare changes; CH result cached by city-key so period changes don't refetch. Files: ffp-admin-dashboard.html v24 (analytics loader lazy cache-bust → v=38) + ffp-admin-analytics-loader.js v4 + RPC live. Verified: all=2, Dubai=2, Brisbane=0.
STANDARDIZED TO TAXONOMY (v5, 2026-06-03): the filter's Country grouping is keyed to the LOCKED taxonomy. The canonical taxonomy lives in DB table taxonomy_items (list_key: country=58, city=541 with parent=country, activity=97, category=12, nationality=60, fitness_level=5, age_group=5, gender=3, experience_type=6). NOTE the standalone `cities` table is EMPTY/unused — taxonomy_items is the source. ffp-taxonomy.js hydrates window.FFP_TAX.cities (country→[cities]) from it via FFP_TAX_READY (anon-readable), with its hardcoded 58-country map as fallback only until that resolves. Analytics loader v5: _ensure awaits FFP_TAX_READY then clears its city→country cache so it keys off the LIVE DB taxonomy not the JS fallback; also re-renders on the 'ffp-tax-ready' event (so admin taxonomy edits reflect). Member cities not present in the taxonomy bucket under "Other" (signals a data-quality issue rather than silently mis-grouping). Files now: ffp-admin-dashboard.html v25 (cache-bust v=39) + ffp-admin-analytics-loader.js v5.

## 6z++. SUNDAY SUMMARY — rebuilt around FFP's 3 PILLARS (2026-06-03, backend v56)
Grant's framing: the email must reflect what FFP stands for, not a generic 8-box grid. Three pillars:
1. YOUR FITNESS vs the community — a RADAR chart scored from the member's OWN values vs healthy ranges (vo2 30–60, bench 40–140, 5km 18:00–40:00 inverted, bio age 25–55 inv, body fat 8–35 inv, active 0–420min) so it VARIES by their real stats + is meaningful even when they're the only member; below it, their PRs with community rank (#x of y once cohort ≥3, else "your best"). ss_score() does the scaling; SS_SCALE holds ranges.
2. YOUR WORLD — places & people: cities + partner venues they've been active in (member_places(p_me) RPC: cities_total/venues_total + _new this week) + connections (total + new). 3 stat cards.
3. PASSPORT STATUS — real progress to next tier using the EARNINGS model: member_tier_progress(p_me) (service-role variant; 8 sections over 30 days) vs SS_TARGETS (each section's Supporter/Ambassador target) and the 4-of-8 rule. Shows current tier, a progress bar (met/4 toward next tier), and the closest 1–2 sections ("1 more provider visit · 1 more quest"). Ambassadors get a "maintain" message.
Inactive members still get the email (nudge copy, not skipped). Dropped the old 8-box glance grid + macros/active bars. New RPCs LIVE: member_tier_progress(uuid), member_places(uuid); member_stat_rankings now returns key+value. Cron fetches digest+rankings+places+tier_progress + member.tier. DEPLOY: backend index.js v56 (Vercel). TEST: ?secret=…&only=YOUR_EMAIL.

## 6z+. EMAILS — charts, send-all, signup + referral (2026-06-03, backend v55)
- REAL CHARTS in the Sunday Summary (Grant: "use real graphs not progress bars"). Email can't run JS/SVG, so charts are QuickChart-rendered PNGs embedded as <img> (display everywhere). renderSundaySummary builds, per member: (1) horizontal bar "Where you rank in <city>" — standing/percentile per tangible PR from d.rankings (100=top); (2) bar "Active minutes vs people like you" (you/city/gender/age from benchmarks.active_minutes); (3) doughnut "Your macros" (protein/carbs/fat from food). Each chart only renders when its data exists; charts REPLACED the rank number cards. Helper qc(config,w,h) → quickchart.io URL (+ optional env QUICKCHART_KEY for rate limits at volume). ssH()/ssImg() helpers.
- SEND TO EVERYONE (Grant): the cron no longer skips zero-activity members — inactive members get an encouraging nudge ("A fresh week starts today — now is the perfect time to get moving", greeting "Hey, <name>", + a prompt to add their records) instead of being skipped. didStuff flag drives active-vs-nudge copy.
- NEW-SIGNUP + REFERRAL emails (Grant): wired into /api/onboard/from-stripe. (1) sendAdminNewSignupEmail → ADMIN_EMAIL (env, default grant@findfitpeople.com) on every new member (name/email/city/referrer). (2) sendReferralEmail → the referrer ("You have a new referral") when a new member signs up via their referral_code. Both use the light brandEmail() shell + existing Resend mailer; non-blocking.
- DESIGN: emails are now LIGHT (white card, navy text, brand accents, FFP logo header — passport-cover header optional once ffp-passport-cover.png is committed), NO emojis, dates formatted (28 May). Mockup FFP-EMAIL-STANDARD.html shows: Example 0 (real charts), the transactional + digest examples.
- DEPLOY (one push): backend index.js v55 + vercel.json (Vercel) + env CRON_SECRET (set) + optional ADMIN_EMAIL/QUICKCHART_KEY + commit ffp-passport-cover.png to assets/ (website) if using the cover header. TEST: /api/cron/sunday-summary?secret=…&only=YOUR_EMAIL.

## 6z. SUNDAY SUMMARY — weekly digest email (2026-06-03) — FIRST P3 email, BUILT
The flagship weekly email (Grant: "Sunday Summary — start the week stronger"), one per active member, covering ALL 8 areas: Food, Activity, Earnings, Meet-ups, Connections, Quests, Events, Challenges — with City/Gender/Age-group benchmarks on the headline Activity stat. No emojis (per standard).
- RANKINGS (LIVE, Grant: "people want tangible rankings — VO2, bench, bio age, 5km, active time"): RPC `member_stat_rankings(p_me)` ranks the member vs their CITY cohort on real PRs from profile_meta (VO2 max, bench, 5km, bio age, body fat, weekly active time — only metrics they have), returns [{label,display,rank,total,better}]. The Sunday Summary now LEADS with these as a 2-col card grid ("#2 of 18 in Dubai" when total≥3, else "Your current best") instead of the abstract activities-count comparison. Empty state prompts members to add their records. The cron route fetches it (d.rankings) + renderSundaySummary renders it (ss_rankCard).
- DATA (LIVE): RPC `member_weekly_digest(p_me)` → JSON {week_start/end, group, activity, food, earnings, meetups, connections, quests, events, challenges, benchmarks{activities,active_minutes,avg_kcal each with you/city/gender/age}}. SECURITY DEFINER, GRANT anon/authenticated. Tested on Grant (7 sessions/252min, benchmarks compute). Age band derived from date_of_birth; cohort = members role='member' sharing city / gender / age band. Migration member_weekly_digest LIVE.
- SEND (backend v54, awaiting Vercel deploy): GET /api/cron/sunday-summary — secured by env CRON_SECRET (Vercel Cron sends Authorization: Bearer; ?secret= for manual test). Loops active+profile_complete members, calls the RPC, renders renderSundaySummary() (matches FFP-EMAIL-STANDARD Example 5), sends via the existing Resend mailer. SKIPS opted-out (members.preferences.no_weekly_email===true) + members with zero activity that week. Returns {sent,skipped,total}.
- SCHEDULE: vercel.json crons → '0 4 * * 0' (Sun 04:00 UTC = 08:00 UAE). ⚠️ Weekly cron needs Vercel PRO (Hobby = daily only). Set env CRON_SECRET before deploy.
- EMAIL TEMPLATE: FFP-EMAIL-STANDARD.html Example 5 (the render mirrors it).
- CAVEAT: sends sequentially in one invocation — fine at current scale; batch/queue if the member base grows large (Vercel function timeout). TEST: deploy, then GET /api/cron/sunday-summary?secret=<CRON_SECRET> to fire a manual run.
DEPLOY: backend index.js v54 + vercel.json (Vercel) + env CRON_SECRET. RPC already LIVE.
TODO (next emails, same pattern): listing-approval, new-review→provider, meetup join/cancel (event-driven via DB webhook → backend route). ADMIN BROADCAST panel (compose → in-app notification + optional Resend email → all/segment by city/gender/age/role/tier) — requested by Grant, NOT built yet.

## 6y. ALPHABETICAL LISTS + FOODS DB + EMAIL STANDARD (2026-06-03)
- ALPHABETICAL (Grant, confirmed): ffp-taxonomy.js v7 sorts NAME lists A–Z at the source — activity, nationality, country, city (A–Z within each country), category, provider_type — so every form on every dashboard inherits it. ORDINAL lists keep their meaningful order: fitness_level (Not Tried→Professional), age_group, gym_size, gender, experience_type, passport. One lever (the hydrator's vals() + the city/country block); no per-form edits needed.
- FOODS DB (Grant: "200+, grouped, with weight/protein/carbs/fat/calories; will grow to 500+"): NEW table public.foods (id, name, category, serving, unit, kcal, protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g, sort_order, active; RLS anon-read active + admin-all). Seeded 237 foods across 14 groups (Protein, Seafood, Dairy & Eggs, Grains & Carbs, Legumes, Vegetables, Fruit, Nuts & Seeds, Fats & Oils, Snacks, Drinks, Fast Food, Condiments, Breakfast & Bakery). Member dashboard v242: FOOD_DB (was a 32-item hardcoded const) is now `let` + hydrates IN PLACE from the table on load (hardcoded list kept as fallback); FOOD_CATS rebuilds from the live groups; the food-picker chips rebuild via CalorieTracker._renderFoodCats() (called in init + openFoodPicker + after hydrate). Add rows to grow to 500+; foods carry macros so they live in their OWN table, NOT taxonomy_items. TODO: a dedicated admin Foods editor (CRUD with macro fields) — for now foods are DB/SQL-editable.
- EMAIL STANDARD (REDESIGNED 2026-06-03, Grant: "more modern/professional, less dark, include logo"): now LIGHT — white card on soft-grey page (#dfe6ed), a NAVY (#0f2c47) header band with the white FFP logo (https://ffppassport.com/assets/ffp-logo.png; swap to ffp-emblem.png for the badge), dark-navy headings (#0f2c47), grey body (#44586a), light stat cards (#f1f7fc/#fff8e1/#f7fafc), accent #2ba8e0, above/below = #1f8fd0/#d65a5a, CTA still yellow #FFCC00 with navy text. The backend renderSundaySummary() was updated to MATCH this light design (so sent emails == the mockup). FFP-EMAIL-STANDARD.html (in repo) — email-client-safe (table + inline styles) template + spec + 4 example renders (meet-up confirmation, cancellation, weekly STATS digest, weekly NUTRITION digest). Use it as the template for all P3 emails. Brand: card #081420, accent #2ba8e0, CTA #FFCC00, from noreply@ffppassport.com (Resend). RULES (Grant): **NO emojis anywhere — ever** (brand standard); every digest stat shows the member's value benchmarked vs their **City, Gender, Age Group** averages (above = blue, below = soft red, shown as %, no arrows) + a "View all stats" / "View all nutrition" CTA. Same pattern for logged food. DATA: a digest RPC (member_weekly_digest(p_me)) must return the member's figures + the three group averages (City=members.city, Gender=members.gender, Age Group=DOB→age_group band) — build alongside the digest emails in P3. NOTE confirmed: existing welcome/code/verify emails already send via Resend (nodemailer → Resend SMTP gateway, port 465, from noreply@ffppassport.com).
DEPLOY: ffp-member-dashboard.html v242 + assets/ffp-taxonomy.js v7 (foods table migrations already LIVE). FFP-EMAIL-STANDARD.html is a reference doc (no deploy needed, but commit it).

## 6x. TAXONOMY AUDIT — FIXES (2026-06-03) — see FFP-TAXONOMY-AUDIT.md for the full assessment
Full field-by-field audit lives in `FFP-TAXONOMY-AUDIT.md` (committed to the repo). Fixes done:
- **P1 — provider_type unified (Grant: "they're the same thing").** Was a conflict: provider profile saved a *business structure* (Single location/Mobile/Coach) while the admin rankings classifier saved a *facility type* (Gym/Studio) into the SAME `providers.provider_type` column → mutual overwrite. RESOLVED into ONE concept. taxonomy_items list_key='provider_type' reseeded (value==label) to: Gym, Studio, Yoga Studio, Pilates Studio, CrossFit Box, Sports Club / Team, Adventure Provider, Wellness Centre, Recovery Studio, Health Food Cafe, Coaching / PT, Event Organizer, Other. The short-lived `business_structure` column + taxonomy list were DROPPED (Find Fit People's "Event organizer" migrated → provider_type "Event Organizer"). provider_save_profile writes provider_type again (guarded). The provider profile "Provider type" field (pf-type) + the admin rankings per-row Type select + filter all read this one list. ffp-taxonomy.js v6 exposes FFP_TAX.providerTypes + gymSizes (hydrate from DB).
- **P2 — killed hardcoded listing-form lists.** Provider event "Level" (em-intensity) + experience "Fitness level" (xm-fitness-level) now read FFP_TAX.fitnessLevels; experience "Type" (xm-type) reads FFP_TAX.experienceTypes (with fallbacks). Admin Taxonomy edits to those lists now propagate to provider forms.
DEPLOY: ffp-provider-dashboard.html v29 + assets/ffp-taxonomy.js v6 (DB migrations provider_business_structure_split + unify_provider_type already LIVE). admin rankings/taxonomies loaders unchanged (already read provider_type live).
- **P3 — EMAIL notifications: STILL TODO (architecture decision needed).** Audit §5 maps where emails should fire (listing approval — the provider banner PROMISES this but none sends; new-review→provider; meetup join/cancel; RSVP/application; new-provider→admin). Backend SMTP/nodemailer infra EXISTS (sendCodeEmail/sendWelcomeEmail/sendProviderVerifyEmail in index.js). BUT the trigger points are Supabase-direct (RPCs/RLS updates), not Express routes — so emailing them needs either (a) an `email_outbox` table the RPCs insert into + a Supabase Edge Function/cron that sends, or (b) RPCs calling a backend endpoint via pg_net. Recommend (a). NOT built yet — confirm the mechanism with Grant before building (also note the admin content loaders that do approvals are flagged corrupt in §2).

## 6w. WORLD MAP — FILTERS BUTTON + FULL-SCREEN FILTER MODAL (2026-06-03) — ffp-member-dashboard.html v237→v240
v240 (Grant fixes — ROOT CAUSE, no patches):
- Removed the location/passport "tags" summary strip above the map (#jm-active-summary deleted + its CSS; updateMapFilterUI now only drives the Filters-button count badge).
- Passport picker default card: the generic FFP cover (assets/ffp-passport-cover.png) is the first card = "All / Worldwide" (tap to clear the lens). So 6 cover cards in the 3-col grid (3+3). Pure images, no overlay text; coloured-label fallback only if an image 404s.
- ROOT-CAUSE FIX — Country/City dropdowns vanished when a passport was selected: the dropdowns were built from passport-FILTERED cities (render() → renderChips(cities) where cities came from logsInRange() which applies the passport filter). The passport is a MAP LENS only. Added logsInRange(ignorePassport); renderChips now builds Country/City from logsInRange(true) (all logged locations, time-scoped) so the dropdowns never disappear regardless of passport.
- ROOT-CAUSE FIX — headline journey stats went blank on passport select: renderAll passed getFilteredLogs() (location + passport) to renderStats, so picking a passport whose mapping didn't match the member's logged categories collapsed the set to empty → tiles read 0. renderAll now feeds renderStats() with getLocationLogs() (location only); map pins + Top Activities/Places keep the lens via getFilteredLogs(). Stat tiles reflect the member's journey and never zero-out from a theme. (The deeper taxonomy issue — many activity_logs categories not mapped to a passport via category.parent — still means a selected passport may show few map pins/Top items; that's a Taxonomies data task, set category→passport parents in admin.)
Earlier history below.
## 6w-prev. WORLD MAP — FILTERS BUTTON + FULL-SCREEN FILTER MODAL (v237/v238)
⚠️ v238 HOTFIX (read this): v237 shipped broken — renderPassportPicker() + updateMapFilterUI() are TOP-LEVEL functions but called `esc()`, which is NOT a global in this file (each IIFE defines its own local `esc`; the global escaper is `escHtml()`, ~L11262). The ReferenceError threw on renderPassportPicker(), which is the FIRST call in renderAll() → renderAll aborted → the entire passport panel (card data, stats, Top Activities/Places/Connections, map) rendered nothing. Grant's report: "no data being pulled into the passport panel." FIX: the 4 calls now use escHtml(). LESSON: top-level member-dashboard code must use the global escHtml(), never esc() (esc is IIFE-local only).
Grant redesign: the passport pills + Country/City dropdowns no longer sit above the map (decluttered). Instead a "Filters" button sits opposite the "World Map" title → opens a full-bleed modal (#map-filter-backdrop, .detail-backdrop dm-full) holding, top→bottom: Country select + City select (#jm-chips, populated by renderChips as before) then the 5 passport-type cards (#jm-passports). Below the title a compact #jm-active-summary shows the current scope (location pill + passport pill); the Filters button carries an active-count badge (passport + country + city). PASSPORT CARDS are now IMAGE cards (renderPassportPicker rewritten): each uses assets/<id>-passport.png — sports/fitness/wellness/adventure + health-food-passport.png — as a cover with a dark scrim + label + per-passport activity count + a check badge when selected; an "All passports" full-width card leads. If an image 404s, onerror hides it and the .jm-pcard-fallback colour (passport colour) shows behind the label, so it never looks broken. Selection still flows through the SAME state (state.selectedPassport via setPassport; Country/City via JourneyMap._onCountry/_onCity) → renderAll; the modal stays open while selecting and updates in place. New fns: openMapFilters / closeMapFilters / clearMapFilters / updateMapFilterUI. The old .jm-pass* pill CSS + .jm-pass-label remain defined but unused (harmless). DEPLOY: ffp-member-dashboard.html v237 + the 5 passport PNGs in assets/ (Grant committed them to GitHub). No DB/RPC change.

## 6v. PROVIDER REVIEW → PROVIDER RANKINGS (2026-06-03) — BUILT end-to-end
Spec (Grant, confirmed): ~1h after a member checks in at a provider venue, an IN-APP prompt invites them to rate the session (Overall + Experience + Service + Facilities stars + comment). Overall drives ranking. Surfaces: provider dashboard (own rating), admin leaderboard, + member-facing discovery (deferred — no provider directory yet). Every review is tied to a REAL activity_logs check-in to keep it honest.

DB: table `public.provider_reviews` (id, member_id, provider_id, activity_log_id, stars_overall/experience/service/facilities, comment, created_at; unique index `provider_reviews_member_log_uq` on (member_id, activity_log_id) WHERE activity_log_id NOT NULL; RLS on, admin-all policy; member/provider access via SECURITY DEFINER RPCs). All RPCs SECURITY DEFINER, GRANT anon/authenticated, trust client-supplied ids (same model as venue_checkin_activity / provider_save_listing). Migrations: `provider_reviews_rpcs`, `provider_rankings_add_category`. All LIVE — no deploy needed for RPCs.
RPCs (LIVE + TESTED on Grant's real check-ins, then test review row deleted — activity_logs untouched):
  - submit_provider_review(p_me,p_provider,p_log,p_overall,p_experience,p_service,p_facilities,p_comment) → uuid. Validates the log row belongs to (member, provider); requires overall 1–5 (categories optional, 1–5 when present); UPSERTs on the (member,log) unique index (re-rating the same check-in updates, no dupes). Returns NULL if the log isn't that member's check-in at that provider (verified: wrong-provider → null; upsert kept row_count=1).
  - member_pending_reviews(p_me) → json[]: activity_logs with provider_id, logged_at < now()-1h, no review yet → {id, provider_id, venue (coalesce log.venue, providers.business_name), activity, logged_at}.
  - provider_rating(p_provider) → json {provider_id, n, avg_overall, avg_experience, avg_service, avg_facilities} (rounded 2dp). PUBLIC — ready for the future discovery surface.
  - provider_reviews_list(p_provider, p_limit=50) → json[] {id, 4× stars, comment, created_at, member_name, member_photo}.
  - provider_rankings() → json[] {provider_id, business_name, city, country, category, status, n, 4× avgs}, ordered by avg_overall desc nulls last, n desc. is_admin()-GATED (raises 'admin only' for n
## (67) PHASE 2 — OWNER-GUARD ON CONFIG MUTATIONS (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Security hardening continued from Phase 0/1 (24 money fns already guarded). Migration
`phase2_owner_guard_config_mutations` injected `perform assert_pro_owner(p_pro)` /
`perform assert_provider_owner(p_provider)` as the FIRST statement after the outer BEGIN of
40 host-initiated config-mutation RPCs (idempotent: skips any already containing the guard;
matched the first \mBEGIN\M only, so nested blocks untouched).
GUARDED (40): pro_save_slot, pro_set_slot_status, pro_save_service, pro_delete_service,
pro_save_client, pro_delete_client, pro_save_payment, pro_delete_payment, pro_delete_package,
pro_save_broadcast, pro_delete_broadcast, pro_request_data_access; provider_save_session,
provider_delete_session, provider_generate_class_sessions, provider_book_appointment,
provider_cancel_appointment, provider_confirm_appointment, provider_reschedule_appointment,
provider_appointment_no_show, provider_save_service, provider_delete_service, provider_save_member,
provider_delete_member, provider_save_payment, provider_delete_payment, provider_delete_package,
provider_delete_plan, provider_save_broadcast, provider_delete_broadcast, provider_save_staff,
provider_delete_staff, provider_save_team, provider_delete_team, provider_save_team_roster,
provider_set_booking_questions, provider_save_quest, provider_quest_meta, provider_request_feature,
provider_request_feature_days.
SAFETY: built the member-facing allowlist from FFP Booking Platform/js/* first — members use
create_booking/book_event_order/cancel_booking/reschedule_class_booking + member_* reads; NONE of
the 40 are called member-side (grep confirmed appointment writes absent from booking platform), so
owner-only guards cannot break member self-booking. assert_* returns early for service_role so the
Vercel backend is unaffected.
VERIFIED (simulated request.jwt.claims): pro non-owner → blocked:forbidden; provider non-owner →
blocked:forbidden; provider OWNER → passed; service_role → passed. Audit: 40/40 guarded, guard is
first executable statement in 40/40.
NO DEPLOY — RPCs are live in Supabase (not in the GitHub repo). Remaining backlog: #44 check-ins
guard-by-caller, #45 Phase 3 private reads (must preserve the member-facing allowlist above).

## (68) PHASE 2b — CHECK-INS: GUARD BY CORRECT CALLER (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Migration `phase2_owner_guard_host_checkins`. The original #44 plan assumed member check-ins
should guard on `auth.uid() = p_me`. INVESTIGATION KILLED THAT ASSUMPTION:
- members link to auth ONLY by email (no user_id col); members.id = auth.uid for just 2/16, and
  only 5/16 members have ANY auth.users row at all. The other 11 operate via the access_code/custom
  path with NO Supabase Auth session → auth.uid() is null for them. A hard self-guard on
  member-initiated check-ins (venue_checkin_*, booking_checkin, pro_checkin_service,
  member_event_checkin, member_quest_progress_checkin) would LOCK OUT the majority of members.
  => DID NOT guard member check-ins. They remain SECURITY DEFINER + client-supplied p_me (documented
     trust model). Proper fix = unify member auth (give every member a Supabase Auth session / a
     members.user_id link) BEFORE any member-side self-guard. Logged as residual risk / future task.
HOST check-ins guarded (called ONLY from pro/provider dashboards, grep-confirmed not in booking
platform; same reliable-auth.uid() context as the 40 Phase 2 fns):
  - pro_checkin_member           -> perform assert_pro_owner(p_professional)
  - provider_checkin_appointment -> perform assert_provider_owner(p_provider)
  - provider_checkin_session     -> perform assert_provider_owner(p_provider)
VERIFIED: random authenticated non-owner -> all three raise 'forbidden' at the guard (before any
mutation). Static: 3/3 guarded, guard is first statement. NO DEPLOY (RPCs live in Supabase).
The two provider_*_checkins SQL functions (provider_event_checkins, provider_quest_checkins) are
READS -> deferred to #45 (Phase 3 private reads).

## (69) PHASE 3 — OWNER-GUARD ON HOST-PRIVATE READS (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Migration `phase3_owner_guard_host_private_reads`. Guarded 54 host-only read RPCs (p_provider/p_pro
first arg, read-only = body has no insert/update/delete) so one pro/provider can't read another's
clients, payments, packages, rosters, reports, attendance, broadcasts, staff, teams, etc.
INJECTION (two languages):
  - plpgsql reads: `perform assert_{pro,provider}_owner(p_{pro,provider})` as first stmt after BEGIN.
  - sql reads: a LEADING `select assert_{pro,provider}_owner(...);` before the original final SELECT
    (SQL fn returns the LAST statement's result, so return type is preserved; verified live).
ALLOWLIST — 5 reads DELIBERATELY LEFT OPEN (member-facing / public discovery), built by grepping
ALL member surfaces (booking platform js/* AND every ffp-member-* loader, incl. the venue-QR
ffp-member-checkin-loader.js which I'd initially missed):
  pro_week_schedule, provider_rating, provider_reviews_list  (booking platform discovery/booking),
  member_provider_options, venue_active_programs               (member venue check-in loader).
VERIFIED (simulated request.jwt.claims): pro_list_services(sql) & provider_list_services(sql) &
pro_client_data(plpgsql) -> OWNER returns data, non-owner -> forbidden; the 2 open reads
(pro_week_schedule, provider_rating) -> still pass for a non-owner. Coverage audit: 54 guarded /
5 open, and the 5 open are EXACTLY the allowlist. NO DEPLOY (RPCs live in Supabase).
SECURITY BACKLOG (Phases 0-3) NOW COMPLETE: 24 money fns (P0/P1) + 40 config mutations (P2) +
3 host check-ins (P2b) + 54 host reads (P3) = 121 RPCs owner-guarded. Residual risk still open:
member auth is fragmented (only 5/16 members have a Supabase Auth session; rest use access_code/
no JWT) -> member-initiated writes still trust client-supplied p_me. See member-auth unification plan.

## (70) MEMBER-AUTH UNIFICATION — PHASE 1 (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, NON-BREAKING, LIVE
Goal: kill the member-auth fragmentation (dashboard mints custom JWT sub=members.id via
/api/auth/signin; booking platform uses native Supabase OTP → auth.users.id linked by email only;
11/16 members have NO auth.users row). Decided end-state (Grant: build for 1M users, reliable):
converge members onto NATIVE Supabase Auth as the single identity, migrated dual-track with zero
lockout. Phase 1 lays the safe substrate, enforcing nothing.
Migration `auth_p1_members_user_id_link_and_self_guard`:
  - members.user_id uuid NULL, FK -> auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, partial-unique
    (members_user_id_uq where user_id is not null).
  - Backfill: user_id=id where members.id is an auth.users id (2); else user_id=auth.users.id by
    lower(email) match. Result: 5/16 linked, 0 bad links.
  - assert_member_self(p_me) [NOT wired into any RPC yet] — DUAL-BRIDGE so it's correct before AND
    after the native migration: pass if service_role; OR p_me=auth.uid() (custom-JWT/dashboard);
    OR members.user_id=auth.uid() for p_me (native/booking); OR is_admin(); else raise forbidden.
VERIFIED (simulated claims): dashboard member (sub=members.id) -> passed; native member
(sub=auth.uid, via user_id) -> passed; service_role -> passed; stranger -> forbidden. col/fk/uniq
all present.
NO DEPLOY (DB only). NEXT — Phase 2 (#47): link-on-login — backend sets members.user_id=auth.uid()
on every member auth (OTP verify + /api/auth/signin) matched by email (REQUIRES backend deploy).
Then P3 dashboard login -> native auth (parallel), P4 enforce assert_member_self on member writes +
retire access_code/custom JWT.

## (71) MEMBER-AUTH UNIFICATION — PHASE 2: LINK-ON-LOGIN (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Root gap found in ensure_member(): the OLD version RETURNED EARLY when a member already existed by
email ("email already claimed") WITHOUT linking the native auth.uid() → that's why booking-platform
logins never linked existing dashboard/Stripe members (only 5/16 linked). It's a DB RPC (called by
the booking platform right after verifyOtp, so auth.uid() inside = the native auth.users.id) → NO
Vercel deploy needed.
Migration `auth_p2_ensure_member_links_user_id` rewrote ensure_member() to link at every branch:
  A) member row already keyed by this native id → set user_id=id (self-link);
  B) existing member owns this email → set members.user_id=auth.uid() (THE FIX; was skipped);
  C) brand-new → insert + link.
All link UPDATEs guarded by `not exists (… user_id=v_id …)` so they can never violate the
members_user_id_uq partial-unique index or break login. Preserves original insert/return behavior.
VERIFIED live (branch B): temp-unlinked a real email-linked member (before=null) → simulated their
native OTP session (sub=their real auth.users id + email claim) → ensure_member relinked to the exact
original user_id (relinked_correctly=true), so data self-restored. Integrity after: 5/16 linked,
0 bad links, 0 dup user_ids. Going forward every booking-platform login auto-links its member.
NEXT — P3 (#48): move the dashboard login to native Supabase Auth (parallel, prove-in-test), which
is what raises the linked count for dashboard-only members; then P4 enforce assert_member_self on
member writes + retire access_code/custom JWT.

## (72) MEMBER-AUTH UNIFICATION — PHASE 3 (HYBRID) — BACKEND FOUNDATION (2026-06-21)
DECISION (after verifying the blast radius): a straight "dashboard → native Supabase Auth" swap is
NOT viable — ~30 member RLS policies are built on auth.uid()=members.id (activity_logs, bookings,
food_logs, transactions, payouts, member_connections, meetups, quest_checkins, members(id=auth.uid),
etc.) + the dashboard reads members/foods/providers directly. Native auth makes auth.uid()=auth.users.id
≠ members.id → every one of those breaks. So we use the HYBRID: native Supabase Auth for the LOGIN
(OTP/magic-link, rate-limited, MFA-capable, no stored 6-digit code) → backend EXCHANGES the verified
native session for the SAME short app-JWT (sub=members.id) the app already uses → RLS layer 100%
unchanged, no id re-key, no policy rewrite.
BACKEND (assets/.../index.js) — added endpoint `POST /api/auth/exchange` (v96), placed right before
/api/auth/reset. Body {access_token} (native Supabase session token). Steps: validate via
supabase.auth.getUser(token) → resolve member by members.user_id link, else by email (link on first
use via members.user_id), else create (user_id set) → status check → return {jwt:mintSupabaseJwt,
refresh:mintRefreshToken, member, redirect} — REUSES the existing mint fns, mirrors /api/auth/signin's
response shape exactly. Runs in PARALLEL with the legacy access_code /api/auth/signin (nothing removed).
VALIDATION: my inserted block passed node --check in isolation. NOTE: full-file `node --check` throws a
FALSE error at the last line via the shell mount (RULE 3 truncation) — the Read tool shows the file is
complete and line 3132 is well-formed; do not trust the shell's full-file parse here.
DEPLOY: Grant commits index.js → Vercel. Additive new route; cannot affect existing flows.
NEXT (still #48): after deploy + smoke-test of /api/auth/exchange, wire the dashboard login UI to the
native OTP → exchange flow (parallel with access_code), prove end-to-end, then P4 enforce
assert_member_self + retire access_code/custom JWT.

## (73) AUTH P3 — DASHBOARD LOGIN WIRED TO HYBRID (member portal) — 2026-06-21
Front half of the hybrid. login.html v20: MEMBER-portal Sign In now uses native Supabase OTP then the
exchange endpoint, instead of the legacy access_code. Reuses the SHARED window.supabase client (built by
ffp-api-integration v12 with the anon key + persistSession:false) → signInWithOtp/verifyOtp return the
session token in-response without persisting; we POST it to /api/auth/exchange and store the returned
app-JWT/refresh/member exactly like FFPApi.verifyCode. handleAuthRedirect unchanged → same dashboards.
SCOPE + SAFETY:
  - Gated by ffpUseNative(flow) = FFP_NATIVE_MEMBER_AUTH && flow==='signin' && selectedPortal==='member'.
    Partner/Professional/Admin sign-in UNTOUCHED (legacy /api/auth/signin). One-line revert: set
    FFP_NATIVE_MEMBER_AUTH=false.
  - Branches added to requestCode (send OTP), resendCode (resend OTP), verifyCode (verifyOtp→exchange→store→redirect).
  - allow_create:false sent on sign-in → backend exchange now returns 404 {no_account} for an unknown email
    instead of creating one (keeps the Become-A-Member funnel). Backend index.js exchange updated for allow_create.
UX: identical (email → 6-digit code), but the code is a SINGLE-USE Supabase OTP, not the permanent
access_code. Existing members: first native sign-in creates+links their auth.users row by email (P2 ensure_member
+ exchange), so members.user_id populates organically as members sign in.
VALIDATION: backend exchange region node --check OK in isolation; login.html main script could not be
full-parsed via the shell (RULE 3 mount truncation — shell sees 779 of ~860 lines); verifyCode native branch
confirmed well-formed via the Read tool (balanced, returns on all paths, legacy fallthrough intact).
DEPLOY (both, backend first): index.js → Vercel (v96 exchange + allow_create); login.html v20 → GitHub→Netlify.
TEST: live login at ffppassport.com → Member → email → native code → lands in member dashboard. Partners/pros/
admins verify still log in as before. NEXT: once members are proven, extend hybrid to the other portals, then
P4 (enforce assert_member_self on member writes + retire access_code/custom JWT).

## (74) AUTH P3 — HYBRID EXTENDED TO ALL PORTALS (2026-06-21)
Member-portal hybrid PROVEN LIVE (GoTrue recorded grant@findfitpeople.com sign-in 13:17Z; Grant
confirmed "tested and working"). Verified provider/pro/admin dashboards all read the SAME session:
ffp-provider-auth.js reads localStorage 'ffp_member' (set by login verifyCode→FFPAuth) and queries
providers by owner_user_id=auth.uid()=members.id via the app-JWT — identical to the member dashboard.
So the native login is transparent to them (only the code SOURCE changes; stored app-JWT/refresh/member
is identical). login.html v21: ffpUseNative() no longer restricts to selectedPortal==='member' → native
OTP→exchange now covers Member/Partner/Professional/Admin sign-in. Flag renamed FFP_NATIVE_MEMBER_AUTH→
FFP_NATIVE_AUTH (one-line revert all portals). Signup (Stripe) + reset screens unchanged. Backend
unchanged (exchange already deployed). DEPLOY: login.html only → GitHub→Netlify. TEST: sign in via
Partner + Professional + Admin portals on ffppassport.com — each should send a code and land on its
dashboard as before. NEXT: P4 (#49) — enforce assert_member_self on member-initiated writes once the
active base has signed in at least once (user_id links accrue per login), then retire access_code +
custom-JWT mint. Members linked will climb from 5/16 as users sign in natively.

## (75) AUTH P4 — ENFORCE MEMBER SELF-GUARD ON WRITES + CLOSE FREE-GRANT HOLES (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Grant chose to flip P4 on now (small known userbase; tell others to sign back in). Safe because the
exchange app-JWT has sub=members.id → a logged-in member always satisfies clause 1 of the dual-bridge
(p_me=auth.uid()); booking-platform native users satisfy clause 2 (members.user_id=auth.uid()) once
linked (P2, on login). Only UNLINKED booking-platform members are blocked until they re-sign-in.
Migration `auth_p4_enforce_member_self_on_writes`: injected `perform assert_member_self(p_me|p_member)`
as the FIRST statement of 47 member-initiated WRITE RPCs (first arg p_me/p_member, has insert/update/
delete, plpgsql, NO existing auth.uid() check, not a host/grant fn). Covers check-ins (venue/booking/
event/quest/pro), activity/meal logs, quests, meetups, connections, challenges, reviews, payouts
(accept/cancel), rsvp, likes, profile_meta, recommend, congratulate, etc.
EXCLUDED (deliberate): book_session/pro_book_slot/create_booking/member_respond_pro_access (already have
their own auth.uid() guards from #41); pro_consume_package_credit (service_role-only, not member-callable).
SECURITY HOLE FOUND + CLOSED (migration `auth_p4b_close_free_grant_holes`): grant_member_plan,
grant_pro_package, professional_link were PUBLIC-EXECUTE (anon+authenticated) with NO auth check — a member
could self-grant a paid plan/package or link anyone as a pro. Guards added: grant_member_plan→
assert_provider_owner(p_provider); grant_pro_package→assert_pro_owner(p_professional) (both called ONLY by
the backend post-Stripe = service_role → payment flow intact, grep-confirmed no client caller);
professional_link→assert_member_self(p_member) (called client-side by a member self-linking as a pro).
VERIFIED: 47/47 self-guarded with guard as first statement; stranger→forbidden on member_like_activity/
rsvp_event/booking_checkin; service_role passes. Free-grant: member→forbidden on all three; service_role/
owner→passes.
DEFERRED (NOT a hole): retire access_code + /api/auth/signin. The app-JWT mint (mintSupabaseJwt) STAYS —
it's the core of the hybrid. /api/auth/signin is kept as the FFP_NATIVE_AUTH=false rollback fallback;
retire it only once native is fully trusted in production. NO DEPLOY (all DB).

## (76) BOOKING MGMT — CANONICAL MEMBER IDENTITY ACROSS SURFACES (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Root issue (latent, would break as the userbase grows past the id-matched testers): create_booking stamped
bookings.member_id = auth.uid(), which is members.id on the dashboard but auth.users.id on the booking
platform (native). So an email-linked member (id<>user_id) booking on one surface couldn't view/cancel/
reschedule on the other (member_my_bookings/cancel_booking/reschedule_class_booking authorize via auth.uid()).
Migration `booking_canonical_member_identity`:
  - NEW helper current_member_id() = members.id for the caller (id=auth.uid() OR user_id=auth.uid()) — the
    same dual-bridge as assert_member_self, returns the canonical platform id on BOTH surfaces.
  - create_booking / cancel_booking / reschedule_class_booking: identity line `v_member := auth.uid()` →
    `:= current_member_id()` (ONLY the identity changes; all capacity/refund/credit-return logic byte-identical).
  - member_my_bookings(p_member): WHERE now bridges (b.member_id = the members.id resolved from p_member as
    id-or-user_id) so it returns the member's bookings whichever id the client passes.
  - Backfilled any booking stamped with a user_id → canonical members.id (0 now; defensive).
VERIFIED: 3/3 fns use current_member_id(), none use raw auth.uid() for identity; resolver returns members.id
for both native(sub=user_id) and dashboard(sub=members.id) sessions; member_my_bookings(user_id)==
member_my_bookings(members.id). Covers all 5 item types for view/cancel (cancel_booking is type-agnostic with
per-type refund policy). NO DEPLOY.
FOLLOW-UPS: (a) booking_checkin stamps bc.member_id from client p_member — canonicalize for the checkin-display
join robustness (#51). (b) member reschedule is class_session-only by design; other types reschedule host-side.
NEXT BIG WORKSTREAM (Grant's real-world req): partner payment MODES — default model #1 (manual/credits always
on; Stripe adds on-system checkout; member always books, charged online only when partner Stripe-connected +
item set pay-online) with per-item option to REQUIRE Stripe (#3). Most infra exists (facility+pro Stripe Connect
LIVE; provider_payments/pro manual ledger w/ method; Service→Package→Payment→credits). Gap = explicit per-item
payment requirement driving the member booking screen + cancel/refund branching by pay method.

## (77) PARTNER PAYMENT MODES — FOUNDATION (per-item requirement + resolver) (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Grant's model: #1 default (manual/credits always on; Stripe adds on-system checkout; member always books,
charged online only if partner Stripe-connected + item set pay-online) with per-item option to REQUIRE
Stripe (#3). "Partner decides" — per item.
Migration `booking_pay_requirement_field`: added `pay_requirement text not null default 'optional'
check in ('free','optional','required')` to the 7 bookable/sellable tables: experiences, events, classes,
provider_sessions, pro_services, pro_packages, provider_plans. Default 'optional' = ZERO behaviour change
until a partner sets it.
Migration `booking_payment_plan_resolver`: new SECURITY DEFINER fn booking_payment_plan(p_item_type,
p_item_id) (granted anon+authenticated) → {ok, price_aed, pay_requirement, partner_kind (facility|
professional), partner_id, partner_has_stripe, action}. ACTION = the booking screen's instruction:
  price=0 or 'free' -> 'free'; 'required' -> 'pay_online' if partner payments_status='connected' else
  'blocked_no_stripe'; 'optional' -> 'pay_online' if connected else 'book_offsystem'. Handles all 5 member
  item types (professional_session p_item_id = pro_slot id → pro_services + professionals.payments_status).
VERIFIED live on real items: class AED75/optional/no-stripe→book_offsystem; provider_session AED110→
book_offsystem; event AED0→free; experience AED7500→book_offsystem; pro_slot AED500 (pro not connected)→
book_offsystem. NO DEPLOY (DB only).
REMAINING SLICES (client, need deploys): (a) PARTNER UI — a per-item "How is this paid?" control
(Free / Pay online if available / Online payment required) on the service/class/event/experience/package
editors in the provider + pro dashboards, writing pay_requirement. (b) MEMBER BOOKING SCREEN — call
booking_payment_plan on the listing, branch: free→book; pay_online→Stripe checkout (existing
session-checkout endpoints); book_offsystem→book now + "pay at venue / partner will arrange";
blocked_no_stripe→hide/disable online booking. (c) CANCEL/REFUND — branch by how it was paid (Stripe refund
vs existing credit-return). Booking identity (#76) already makes member cancel/reschedule work cross-surface.

## (78) PARTNER PAYMENT MODES — PARTNER UI slice 1 (PRO services + packages) (2026-06-21)
Migration `pro_save_service_package_pay_requirement`: pro_save_service + pro_save_package now persist
p->>'pay_requirement' (insert: coalesce(...,'optional'); update: case when p ? 'pay_requirement' …);
assert_pro_owner guard preserved. CLIENT: added a "How is this paid?" <select> (Free / Pay online if
available / Online payment required) to the pro SERVICE editor (ffp-professional-services-loader.js:
openServiceModal default+field, saveService payload) and the pro PACKAGE editor
(ffp-professional-client-loader.js: openPlanModal default+field, savePlan payload). Default 'optional'.
PRO_BUILD 52→53. VALIDATION: openServiceModal + openPlanModal pass isolated node --check (full-file
parse is a RULE 3 mount-truncation false positive — files confirmed intact via Read tool).
DEPLOY: ffp-professional-services-loader.js + ffp-professional-client-loader.js + ffp-professional-
dashboard.html → GitHub→Netlify. Backend unchanged (persistence is in the DB RPCs, already live).
NEXT: provider (facility) editors — classes / events / experiences / provider_sessions(session_templates)
/ provider_plans save RPCs + their loaders (same pattern). Then member booking screen branches on
booking_payment_plan.action; then cancel/refund branch by pay method.

## (78b) FIX — pay_requirement read-back (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Grant: "did not remember my choice." Root cause: pro_save_service/pro_save_package PERSIST pay_requirement
(verified: a pro_service row already = 'free'), but pro_list_services/pro_list_packages build an explicit
jsonb that OMITTED pay_requirement → editor read editing.pay_requirement = undefined → dropdown fell back to
'optional'. Migration `pro_list_services_packages_return_pay_requirement`: added 'pay_requirement' to both
list jsonb objects (assert_pro_owner guard preserved). Verified pro_list_services now returns
["free","optional",...]. NO redeploy (client already reads the field) — just reload.
LESSON for the facility slice: every *_list_* RPC builds a fixed jsonb — must add the new column to the
READ side too, not only the save RPC.

## (79) PRO CATALOG — TYPE-OR-SPECIFIC PACKAGE BINDING + service↔packages view (2026-06-21)
Grant's confirmed model (most was ALREADY there from #29 credit-binding; this adds the TYPE layer):
Service (One-on-One/Group/Assessment, service_type) is NOT purchased; PACKAGE is purchased (carries price +
pay_requirement), grants credits, and binds to a specific service OR a service TYPE OR any. Booking spends a
covering credit; no covering credit → buy a matching package.
Migration `pro_package_service_type_binding` (DELTA): added service_type to pro_packages + pro_client_packages;
pro_save_package persists service_type; grant_pro_package + pro_assign_package COPY service_type to the client
package instance (alongside the existing service_id copy); pro_consume_package_credit now matches
service_id=service (specific) OR (service_id null & service_type=booked type) OR (service_id null & service_type
null = generic), ordered specific→type→generic then soonest expiry (burns least-flexible credit first);
pro_list_packages returns service_type. All assert_pro_owner guards preserved.
CLIENT: package editor (ffp-professional-client-loader.js) "For which service" → "Works for" <select> grouped:
specific services / "Any <Type> service" / Any service; savePlan parses (type: prefix / 'any' / id) into
service_id+service_type. Service editor (ffp-professional-services-loader.js) now fetches pro_list_packages and
shows "Packages that book this service" (specific + type + generic) or a "Create a package" hint. Service
"How is this paid?" was REVERTED (payment lives on the package, not the service). PRO_BUILD 53→54.
booking_payment_plan resolver: professional_session branch replaced by pro_package + provider_plan (payment =
package PURCHASE, not slot booking).
VALIDATION: openServiceModal + openPlanModal + savePlan pass isolated node --check (full-file = RULE 3 mount
truncation). DEPLOY: ffp-professional-client-loader.js + ffp-professional-services-loader.js + ffp-professional-
dashboard.html → GitHub→Netlify (Build 54). Backend unchanged. DB delta already live.

## (79b) CORRECTION — package binds to a PRO-SELECTED SET OF SERVICES (multi-select) (2026-06-21)
Grant: the professional must pick WHICH of THEIR services a package works with — no invented type/"any"
options. Superseded the service_type approach (79) with a multi-service set the pro builds themselves.
Migration `pro_package_multi_service_binding`: pro_packages.service_ids uuid[] + pro_client_packages.service_ids
uuid[] (backfilled from service_id). pro_save_package writes service_ids from p->'service_ids' (jsonb array;
service_id kept = first, for legacy name). grant_pro_package + pro_assign_package snapshot service_ids onto the
client package. pro_consume_package_credit: covers the service iff p_service = any(cp.service_ids), OR the set is
empty/null (= any) — restricted packages preferred over generic, then soonest expiry. pro_list_packages returns
service_ids + service_names[]. service_type columns left dormant (unused). All assert_pro_owner guards preserved.
CLIENT: package editor "Works for which services?" = CHECKBOXES of the pro's own services (pl-works-cb),
pre-checked from service_ids; savePlan collects checked → service_ids[] (requires >=1). Service editor "Packages
that book this service" filter now = service in pk.service_ids (empty = any). PRO_BUILD 54.
VERIFIED (rolled-back tx): package covering only service A → book A = consumed; book B = no_active_package.
Client fns pass isolated node --check. DEPLOY: ffp-professional-client-loader.js + ffp-professional-services-
loader.js + ffp-professional-dashboard.html (Build 54) → GitHub→Netlify. DB live; backend unchanged.

## (80) FACILITY PAYMENT MODES — slice 1: PLAN "How is this paid?" (2026-06-21)
Grant: facilities do ALL — drop-in direct pay + class-packs + memberships. Started with the clearest parallel
to the pro package: the facility PLAN (membership/pack) payment control.
Migration `provider_plan_pay_requirement`: provider_save_plan + provider_list_plans now persist/return
pay_requirement (column already existed); assert_provider_owner guards preserved.
CLIENT: provider plan editor (ffp-provider-members-loader.js openPlanModal/savePlan) gained the "How is this
paid?" <select> (Free / Pay online if available / Online payment required), default 'optional'. Loader bumped
ffp-provider-members-loader.js ?v=5→6 in ffp-provider-dashboard.html _provLoaderSrc. Isolated node --check OK.
DEPLOY: ffp-provider-members-loader.js + ffp-provider-dashboard.html → GitHub→Netlify.
REMAINING FACILITY WORK (sliced to keep quality; flagged, not yet built):
  (a) Facility plan "works for which classes/services" binding — BLOCKED on tracing the facility credit-
      consumption path: provider_member_plans has NO service binding and it's unclear which fn decrements its
      credits for which bookable (create_booking creates pending/unpaid, doesn't consume). Must trace before
      building the binding so it's correct (avoid pro-side churn).
  (b) Facility LISTING "How is this paid?" (drop-in): classes/events/experiences are owner-RLS DIRECT-table
      edits (no save RPC) → add pay_requirement to those client editors' payloads; provider_sessions via
      provider_save_session + session_templates (template→session propagation needed).
  (c) MEMBER booking screen — branch on booking_payment_plan.action (free/pay_online/book_offsystem/blocked).
rch + country/city/duration/date, no provider, no GPS → log_activity RPC. These are separate by design; do not merge.
- ffp-member-checkin-loader.js **v2** (script ref `?v=2`): removed the full-taxonomy fallback in openContext (was falling back to FFP_TAX when a provider had no activities — wrong). Now: provider activities only; if none listed, shows "this venue hasn't listed its activities yet → use Log Activity" instead. Modal is now FULL-PAGE (`.ci-sheet.full`, 100dvh) with a scrollable list of TAPPABLE activity buttons (`.ci-act`, selected = yellow `.sel`) instead of a <select>; selection held in `_pickedAct`, exposed via FFPCheckin._pick. DEPLOY ffp-member-checkin-loader.js.
- PROVIDER PROFILE SAVE fixed (ffp-provider-profile-loader.js **v10**): the auth.uid() trap struck again — the old direct providers.update silently wrote 0 rows (activities/lat/lng/maps_url never saved) and provider_hours insert hard-failed RLS (42501, see Grant's screenshots). FIX: new SECURITY DEFINER RPC `provider_save_profile(p_provider uuid, p jsonb, p_hours jsonb)` (GRANT anon, authenticated) — updates providers (all profile fields incl. activities/latitude/longitude/maps_url) + replaces provider_hours in one call; returns true. Loader realSaveProfile now calls it and only confirms on data===true. VERIFIED via SQL: provider_hours got the inserted row (day 3, 08:00–20:00). DEPLOY ffp-provider-profile-loader.js.

## 6d. CHECK-IN CONSOLIDATION + NAMING (2026-06-01)
NAMING RULE (Grant): NO version suffixes in filenames anywhere (-v2 etc.). Version lives in the file header comment + the `?v=` cache-bust on the <script> tag. One clean filename per file.
- NEW single member check-in file: **ffp-member-checkin-loader.js** (v1). Self-contained (own CSS, scanner, ?venue= handler, provider-activity list, GPS verify, RPC save). Member dashboard <script> now points to `ffp-member-checkin-loader.js?v=1` (was the phantom ffp-member-quest-scan-loader-v2.js).
- DELETE FROM GITHUB (replaced, now orphaned): `ffp-member-quest-scan-loader-v2.js` (was the live one) AND `ffp-member-quest-scan-loader.js` (older non-v2). Both superseded by ffp-member-checkin-loader.js.
- TRADE-OFF: the old quest-scan loader also did scan→quest-stamp; the new checkin-loader does ACTIVITY check-in only for now. Fold quest stamping + challenge completion back into ffp-member-checkin-loader.js when building the Quests loop (#72). Provider-side quest approval (ffp-provider-quests-loader.js) is untouched.
- DATA LAYER live: providers.activities text[] (activities offered); activity_logs + verified/checkin_lat/checkin_lng; RPC venue_checkin_activity(p_me,p_provider,p_activity,p_duration_min,p_notes,p_lat,p_lng)→json{id,verified,distance_m,venue} (verified = within 250 m of provider lat/long). GRANT anon/authenticated.
- PROVIDER SETUP BUILT (ffp-provider-profile-loader.js v7): "Activities we offer" chips (→ providers.activities[]) + "Venue location" current-location capture (→ providers.latitude/longitude), injected into #panel-profile; load + save wired (rides the existing providers.update().eq('id',id) path; also fixed country missing from the select). This feeds the member check-in's activity list + GPS verification. CHECK-IN LOOP NOW COMPLETE end-to-end. Deploy ffp-provider-profile-loader.js.
- SINGLE member entry point: the yellow "Scan QR" button on the Passport panel (openScanLog → FFPCheckin.scan) + the ?venue= link.
- VENUE LOCATION = Google Maps link (Grant's call, "backend resolves any link"): provider pastes their Maps link in the profile → "Find pin" calls backend GET /api/geo/resolve?url= (backend v50: follows short-link redirect via fetch, parseLatLng from @lat,lng / !3d!4d / q= / ll= / final URL / body) → sets providers.latitude/longitude; the link itself is stored in providers.maps_url (new column) for a member "Directions" button. ffp-provider-profile-loader.js v8. parseLatLng verified on all formats; short links resolve server-side. DEPLOY: backend v50 (Vercel) + ffp-provider-profile-loader.js v8 (Netlify). CORS already '*'. The loader no longer injects a Quests-panel button.

## 6c. PROVIDER QR CHECK-IN → PASSPORT ACTIVITY (2026-06-01) — core loop live
Provider QR encodes `ffp-member-dashboard.html?venue=<provider_id>` (ffp-provider-venue-qr-loader.js — fixed: it was selecting providers.passport_no which doesn't exist → blanked the QR card; now selects business_name only). Member scan flow (ffp-member-quest-scan-loader.js): scan/paste → context sheet now leads with **"Log activity"** → activity picker (FFP_TAX.activities) + optional duration → RPC `venue_checkin_activity(p_me, p_provider, p_activity, p_duration_min, p_notes)` (SECURITY DEFINER, GRANT anon/authenticated) inserts activity_logs with provider_id + venue=business_name + city/country from the provider. TESTED ✓ (insert+cleanup). Quest check-in branch unchanged. EVENT check-in = next layer (provider as event organizer → member checks into their event → logs activity); still "Coming soon" in the sheet. DEPLOY: ffp-member-quest-scan-loader.js + ffp-provider-venue-qr-loader.js (RPC already live).

## 6b. PROVIDER/ADMIN ACCOUNTS MUST NOT APPEAR AS MEMBERS (2026-06-01)
A provider = a members row with role='provider' (needed for login). They must NEVER count/show as community members. Locked down on every surface:
- `get_match_pool` RPC (Matches deck): already had `AND m.role='member'` ✓.
- members RLS: ONLY `members_self_all` (auth.uid()=id OR is_admin()) — a member can't read other members directly; discovery only via SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (filtered). ✓.
- Admin **Members** panel (ffp-admin-members-loader.js): `.filter(m => m.role==='member')` ✓.
- `admin_overview()` RPC: members_total now `WHERE coalesce(role,'member')='member'` (providers/admin excluded from the count). Recent-activity feed KEEPS provider-role members but LABELS them "Joined as a provider contact" (vs "Signed up · paid" for members); admins hidden from the feed; provider-applications union limited to status='pending'. (Grant's call: show provider contacts, identified — don't hide.) Live in DB; Overview caches client-side so hit Refresh to see it. ✓.
- `get_ranking_pool()` RPC (leaderboards): added `AND coalesce(role,'member')='member'`. ✓.
- Admin **Analytics** (ffp-admin-analytics-loader.js): members fetch now `.eq('role','member')`. ✓.
RPCs are SECURITY DEFINER, live in DB (no deploy). Frontend to deploy: ffp-admin-analytics-loader.js (+ the earlier ffp-admin-members-loader.js / admin v36). NOT yet role-checked (low risk, provider-facing only): provider_event_rsvps / provider_experience_applications (they show members who RSVP'd/applied to a provider's own listing).

## 6. TAXONOMY → DATABASE (admin-editable, live everywhere) — ✅ BUILT 2026-06-01 (flat lists)
DONE: `public.taxonomy_items(list_key,value,label,sort_order,active)` table + RLS (anon/auth read active; admin read-all + write via is_admin). Seeded 183 items from code defaults: activity 97, nationality 60, category 12, fitness_level 5, gender 4, age_group 5. Admin **Taxonomies** panel = real CRUD via `ffp-admin-taxonomies-loader.js` v1 (add / rename / reorder / show-hide / delete per list). `assets/ffp-taxonomy.js` **v4** hydrates `FFP_TAX` (and `FFP_CONST.providerCategories`) from the table on load, mutating arrays IN PLACE; hardcoded lists remain the fallback if Supabase isn't present (fail-safe, no breakage). Exposes `window.FFP_TAX_READY` (promise) + fires `ffp-tax-ready` event. DEPLOY: admin v33 + ffp-admin-taxonomies-loader.js (new) + assets/ffp-taxonomy.js v4.
PROPAGATION CAVEAT: hydration is async — forms built on DOMContentLoaded use whatever's loaded at that moment. On pages that load supabase-js BEFORE ffp-taxonomy.js (apply, all dashboards) the fetch client exists; instant propagation to an ALREADY-rendered dropdown needs the form to await FFP_TAX_READY / listen for 'ffp-tax-ready' (wire per-form later if needed). A page refresh always shows latest.
STILL TODO: CITIES are country-nested (cascade) — NOT in this flat editor yet; activities here lose category grouping 'c' for NEW items (preserved for existing by name). Unify the split level vocab later.

### (original notes kept for reference)
GOAL: one DB-driven taxonomy that the Admin dashboard edits and EVERY form reads live, so admin changes propagate platform-wide.
CURRENT STATE (the problem): taxonomy is split + mostly hardcoded, admin can't edit.
- Hardcoded in `assets/ffp-taxonomy.js` (FFP_TAX: activities ~95, cities 58-country map, fitnessLevels, nationalities, genders, ageGroups, professionalRoles) — member side reads this.
- DB tables exist: `activity_types` (379, LIVE source for provider pickers, now anon-readable), `activities`, `cities`.
- Admin "Taxonomies" panel (`panel-taxonomies`, ffp-admin-dashboard.html ~1840) is a STUB — Activities tile = `onclick="showToast('Activities editor coming')"`, no loader, no DB write path.
- Duplicates/conflicts: events-loader `FFP_CATEGORIES` (23, unused); experiences-loader `FFP_CITIES` (dup of FFP_TAX.cities AND corrupted — doc text as fake cities under Turkey); THREE level vocabularies (FFP_TAX.fitnessLevels = Not Tried/Social/Competitive/Representative/Professional; events form same; experiences form = Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Elite/Professional; events DB check now accepts BOTH).
TO BUILD (all types, working):
1. Canonical DB tables (or one key/value `taxonomy` table) for: activities (use activity_types), categories, cities, fitness levels (UNIFY the 3 vocabs to one), event settings, experience types, nationalities/genders/ageGroups. Each with active + sort_order.
2. Admin Taxonomies panel = real CRUD writing to those tables (admins use real Supabase Auth → direct RLS writes OK; activity_types_admin policy already exists).
3. All consumers READ from DB: provider forms (activities already do; point category/city/level/setting/exp-type at DB), member dashboard (replace FFP_TAX reads), retire the hardcoded lists + the corrupted FFP_CITIES.
4. Fix the corrupted Turkey city list as part of migrating cities to DB.

## 4. FORM STANDARDS
Activity picker full-screen on mobile; Time = native tap `<input type=time>`; **Date = native single-tap `<input type=date>`** (meetup defaults today + min today; log-activity defaults today, past allowed); Country→City cascade defaulting to the member's profile location where relevant; Age From/To; labels weight 600 (`.pm-form-label`/`.form-label`); data-entry forms full-screen on mobile; native date/time/select inputs need `min-width:0; box-sizing:border-box` or they overshoot their grid column on iOS; primary CTA yellow `#FFCC00`; Location field + Google Maps link; notifications = top banner; money display USD.

## 7. PROVIDER SELF-SIGNUP — PHASE 1 ("Try for free") — BUILT 2026-06-01, AWAITING DEPLOY
GOAL (Grant + Phillip): let providers self-register → instant dashboard → build listings → admin approves to go LIVE. Free during preview. Phase 2 later = pay-to-publish (providers.paid_until / subscription_tier / monthly_fee_aed already exist).
### Auth model recap (confirmed)
A provider = a `members` row with `role='provider'` (status MUST be 'active' for signin) + a `providers` row linked by `owner_user_id = members.id`. Login is shared `login.html` (Member/Provider/Admin portals); providers go straight to `ffp-provider-dashboard.html` (no profile-complete). `ffp-provider-auth.js` lets a provider into the dashboard as long as a providers row exists — pending status is fine; the **listing-level** approval is the real gate. Backend mints an opaque random token at signin (NOT a JWT); no JWT lib present, only `crypto`.
### Chosen flow (Grant): EMAIL VERIFICATION
signup → verification email → click "Confirm email & log in" → backend marks verified, 302 → `login.html?verified=1&email=…` → login page (Partner portal preselected, email prefilled) → "Get My Code" (existing `/api/auth/reset`) → enter 6-digit code (`/api/auth/signin`) → provider dashboard.
### DEPLOY QUEUE — versions (Phase 1)

| ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js | exp-type/fitness from FFP_TAX | GitHub main → Netlify |
| assets/ffp-location-picker.js | re-init on ffp-tax-ready | GitHub main → Netlify |

### "REVERTS TO OLD VERSION" (admin Events/Experiences/Challenges) — FIXED 2026-06-01
Loaders augment the dashboard's inline demo modules but their init() never rendered → inline demo (Upcoming/Past/Cancelled) stayed on screen. FIX: each loader init() now calls refresh() after wiring overrides → renders real DB data + real tabs on load, permanently. (events→v2.)
### SETTINGS CONNECTED 2026-06-01
New public.admin_audit table + RLS. Dashboard AuditLog is DB-backed (add() persists, load() fetches last 50; demo seed removed). ffp-admin-settings-loader.js renders FFP Team from admin_users + loads audit on Settings open; wired in _panelScript. Platform Config readonly (from ffp-constants.js). admin_users has no name/email (auth.users not client-readable) → non-current admins show role+added only.
| ffp-admin-taxonomies-loader.js | **v1 (new)** | GitHub main → Netlify |
| assets/ffp-taxonomy.js | **v4** | GitHub main → Netlify |
| ffp-admin-events-loader.js | **v3** | GitHub main → Netlify |

### MARKETPLACE APPROVAL PANELS — VERIFIED WORKING (2026-06-01), blocked only by stale deploy
Admin Events/Experiences/Challenges loaders (events v3 + exp + chal): default Pending tab, fetch real rows, sidebar pending badge, Approve → status='live' (Archive/Cancel too). All `node --check` OK. RLS verified: `*_member_read` has `OR is_admin()` (admin reads pending), `*_admin_all` (ALL, authenticated, admin_users) lets admin UPDATE (approve commits). DB has 3 pending events + 2 pending experiences + 0 challenges right now. The LIVE admin shows 0 only because it's the OLD deploy (footer "v1.0", panel defaulted to Past = inline demo module). DEPLOY admin v32 + the 3 admin loaders → panels show the real pending listings with working Approve. Closes provider-upload → admin-approve → member-discovery loop.

### PROVIDER INTAKE MODEL (2026-06-01, CORRECTED per Grant) — INSTANT, self-serve, NO account approval
DECISION (Grant, emphatic): a provider self-signs up and can **start using + uploading immediately**, with NO admin approval of their ACCOUNT. **There is NO Applications panel and NO provider-account approval queue.**
- Self-signup (backend v49) → `providers` row created **status='approved'** + approved_at=now() (member role=provider, owner_user_id set). They confirm email → log in → straight into the dashboard and build/upload listings. No gate.
- Admin **Providers** panel = a directory/management view (Approved / Featured / Suspended), NOT an approval queue. New providers appear under Approved. Admin can suspend/feature reactively.
- **Applications panel REMOVED** (admin v31): deleted the `ffp-admin-applications-loader.js` script tag + the `panel-applications` entry in `_panelScript`. apply.html / `provider_applications` is dead legacy (homepage links /partner → /provider-signup, not /apply).
- Reverted the v30 "Pending" provider tab — that wrongly implied account approval.
- LISTINGS (events/experiences/challenges) still save `status='pending'` via provider_save_listing; whether they auto-go-live or need a per-listing approval (in the content panels) is the OPEN question — confirm with Grant. The ACCOUNT itself is never gated.
- DB: test row deleted; ran `update providers set status='approved' where status='pending'`.
- apply.html RETIRED → now a redirect to /provider-signup.html (v4). It used to write `provider_applications` (orphaned once Applications panel removed). No more applications created.
- FORGE FITNESS migration (2026-06-01): "Forge Fitness + Performance" (Phil Elder, phil@forgefitness.ae) had applied via the old form → sat in provider_applications, so it never showed in the Providers panel. CONVERTED to a real provider: created member (role=provider, status active, id 7b0307bf-f43e-4817-903c-bdf4dac6171a) + providers row (id 370cb2dc-dfd0-48b3-8147-7ffdf0f9bba2, status approved). Phil logs in at /login Partner portal → enter email → "Get my code" (no password). provider_applications row marked status='approved' (constraint allows pending/approved/rejected, NOT 'converted').

### Files changed (DEPLOY these)
1. **assets/ffp-passport-backend-main/.../index.js** — added (after `/api/auth/reset`, ~L628): `signProviderToken`/`verifyProviderToken` (HMAC-SHA256 over `memberId.expiry` using server-only `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, 7-day expiry, timingSafeEqual), `sendProviderVerifyEmail`, `POST /api/provider/signup` (validates; 409 if email exists; inserts member role=provider/status=active/verified=false + providers row status=pending; rolls back member if provider insert fails; emails verify link built from `https://${req.get('host')}`), `GET /api/provider/verify` (validates token → sets members.verified=true → 302 to login). Syntax + token round-trip verified. **DEPLOY: push backend to Vercel (ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app). No new env vars required** (reuses SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY + SMTP_*). Optional: set SITE_URL (defaults to https://ffppassport.com).
2. **provider-signup.html** (NEW) — quick signup form (business name, contact first/last, email, phone cc+num, country/city cascade, category, main activity, website, about). Posts JSON to `https://ffp-passport-backend.vercel.app/api/provider/signup`. Required: business_name, contact name, email, country, city, category. Uses ffp-constants (categories) + ffp-taxonomy (phoneCodes, activities) + ffp-location-picker (group `psignup`). Success card = "check your email" 3-step. Inline JS node --check OK.
3. **partner.html** — nav CTA "Join Now"→**"Try Free"** (/provider-signup.html); hero primary →**"Try For Free"** (/provider-signup.html), secondary now "See Partnership Options"; free-tier CTA "Start Free Listing"→**"Try For Free"** (/provider-signup.html). (bash sees partner.html as "binary"/NUL-padded in the mount — edits were made on the clean canonical copy via the Edit tool and confirmed by Read.)
4. **login.html** — DOMContentLoaded now handles `?verified=1&email=` (preselect Partner portal, prefill email, "Email confirmed" sub) and `?verify=expired|error` (fresh-code prompt).
### NOT in Phase 1 (Phase 2 / later)
Payment/pay-to-publish; admin notification when a new provider signs up (admin sees them in Providers/Applications already by status); requiring verified=true before signin (currently signin only checks status='active' — the verify click is the email-ownership proof).

## (81) FACILITY MEMBERSHIP/PACK — session binding + unlimited-vs-credit consume (2026-06-21)
Grant's facility model: term/recurring membership = UNLIMITED access to its sessions; class pack = N credits
spent per session. Partner selects WHICH sessions (session_templates) a plan covers (book_session books
provider_sessions via occ.template_id; the `classes` table is the separate Experiences product).
Migration `provider_plan_session_binding_data`: provider_plans.template_ids uuid[]; provider_member_plans
.template_ids uuid[] + plan_type text (backfilled from plan). provider_save_plan persists template_ids;
grant_member_plan + provider_assign_plan snapshot template_ids + plan_type onto the member plan; provider_list_plans
returns template_ids + session_names[]. All assert_provider_owner guards preserved.
Migration `book_session_membership_binding_consume`: rewrote book_session credit branch — picks an active plan
that COVERS the session (template_ids empty/null = all, else occ.template_id = any(template_ids)) AND is a
membership (plan_type recurring/term → UNLIMITED, no decrement) OR a pack with credits_remaining>=qty (→
decrement). Order: membership first (don't burn pack credits), then session-specific over covers-all, then
soonest expiry. paid_with='membership'|'credit'. ALSO fixed book_session identity guard auth.uid()<>p_member →
current_member_id() bridge (cross-surface, like #50/create_booking).
VERIFIED (rolled-back tx): term membership covering session → paid_with=membership, credits_left=null (no
decrement); pack covering session → credit, 5→4; pack covering a DIFFERENT session → needs_payment.
CLIENT: facility plan editor (ffp-provider-members-loader.js openPlanModal now async) fetches
provider_list_session_templates and shows "Works for which sessions?" checkboxes (pm-works-cb), pre-checked from
template_ids; savePlan collects → template_ids[] (empty = every session). Loader ?v=6→7. Isolated node --check OK.
DEPLOY: ffp-provider-members-loader.js + ffp-provider-dashboard.html → GitHub→Netlify. DB live; backend unchanged.
NOTE: pro_book_slot still has the legacy auth.uid()<>p_member guard (same native-auth issue) — fix next for
parity. Facility LISTING drop-in "How is this paid?" + member booking screen still pending.

## (82) FACILITY MANUAL PAYMENT → GRANTS PLAN + pro_book_slot identity parity (2026-06-21)
(a) Migration `pro_book_slot_identity_bridge`: pro_book_slot guard auth.uid()<>p_member → current_member_id()
    (cross-surface, parity with #50/book_session). Verified pro_book_slot now references current_member_id().
(b) Grant's reminder: facilities (like pros) must manage WITHOUT on-system payment — record manual input
    (cash/bank deposit/direct debit) that GRANTS the plan. The facility ALREADY had a manual ledger
    (provider_save_payment / provider_payments, method field) but it was free-text revenue only — no plan
    link, no credit grant. Brought to PARITY with the pro billing flow (all client, ffp-provider-billing-loader.js):
    - PAY_METHODS expanded: + bank_deposit, direct_debit, cheque (was cash/card/transfer/online/other).
    - _ensureBillPlans (provider_list_plans) + _payPlanPick (auto-fills amount/description from the chosen plan).
    - Payment modal: new "Plan purchased (optional)" picker — a plan OR "Other / one-off (no plan)" (keeps
      drop-in/misc revenue free-text). 
    - savePayment: records provider_save_payment with plan_id; if a plan + member chosen → calls
      provider_assign_plan (grants the membership/credits, snapshotting template_ids+plan_type per #81). Validates
      "choose the member who bought this plan". One toast: "Payment recorded · plan granted" / soft error if grant fails.
    Loader ffp-provider-billing-loader.js ?v=3→4. Isolated node --check OK.
DEPLOY: ffp-provider-billing-loader.js + ffp-provider-dashboard.html → GitHub→Netlify. DB live; backend unchanged.

## (83) FACILITY LISTING drop-in "How is this paid?" — slice 1: SESSIONS (2026-06-21)
Migration `session_template_pay_requirement`: added pay_requirement to session_templates (default optional);
provider_save_session_template persists it AND copies it into every generated provider_sessions row (so the
booking_payment_plan resolver, which reads provider_sessions.pay_requirement, reflects the template setting);
provider_list_session_templates returns it. assert_provider_owner guard preserved.
CLIENT: ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js openTemplateModal + saveTemplate gained the "How is this paid?"
<select> (drop-in payment for non-members; members on a covering plan book with credits). Loader ?v=21→22.
Isolated node --check OK. DEPLOY: ffp-provider-scheduling-loader.js + ffp-provider-dashboard.html → Netlify.
REMAINING: marketplace listings classes(Experiences)/experiences(Trips)/events "How is this paid?" (columns
already exist; editors need the dropdown — check save path direct-table vs RPC); then MEMBER booking screen.

## (83b) SECURITY — provider_save_listing owner guard (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY
provider_save_listing(p_kind, p_provider, p_id, p) (unified save for event/experience/class/challenge) had
NO owner guard — anyone could INSERT a listing under any provider (updates were already p_provider-scoped).
Migration `provider_save_listing_owner_guard`: injected `perform assert_provider_owner(p_provider)` after the
null-check. Verified guarded + near top. NO DEPLOY.
DEFERRED: marketplace-listing drop-in pay_requirement (Experiences/Trips/Events) — columns exist + default
'optional' already gives correct behaviour; the 150-line provider_save_listing has 6 insert/update spots so
threading the field is higher-risk for low marginal value (these are inherently pay-to-attend). Revisit if needed.
NEXT (the big consumer payoff): MEMBER booking screen on the booking platform (FFP Booking Platform) — branch
on booking_payment_plan.action (free→book / pay_online→Stripe checkout / book_offsystem→book+settle / blocked).

## (83c) DECISION — marketplace-listing drop-in control: NOT building (2026-06-21)
Grant delegated the call ("low value, your call"). DECISION: skip. classes(Experiences)/experiences(Trips)/
events default pay_requirement='optional' which already gives correct member behaviour (pay online if partner
Stripe-connected, else book + settle off-system). Adding the toggle only enables rare 'free'/'required' edge
cases; the safe build paths (thread through 150-line provider_save_listing, or direct-table writes bypassing the
SECURITY DEFINER pattern) carry regression risk on revenue code for marginal value. Columns exist; trivial
contained follow-up if a real need surfaces. Partner payment-mode work otherwise COMPLETE (pro + facility:
services/packages/plans/sessions catalog + binding + manual-payment-grants-plan + Stripe). Member screen = Booking
team's (spec handed off: FFP Booking Platform/FFP-MEMBER-BOOKING-PAYMENT-SPEC.md).

## (84) MARKETPLACE: PAY-BEFORE-CONFIRM RULE (Experiences/Trips/Events) (2026-06-21)
Grant: paid Experience/Event/Trip can't be booked unless paid for (payment before confirmation) UNLESS the
partner explicitly allows otherwise. (Reverses the earlier "skip" — this is a real rule.)
Migration `marketplace_pay_before_confirm_default`: classes/events/experiences pay_requirement DEFAULT → 'required';
backfilled existing PAID rows optional→required (2 trips, 3 events, 6 experiences); provider_save_listing now
threads p->>'pay_requirement' (single guarded step before return; coalesce default 'required') for event/
experience/class. Resolver already turns 'required' into action pay_online (partner on Stripe) / blocked_no_stripe
(not) — so the member screen must take payment before confirming.
CLIENT (partner opt-out toggle "Allow booking without upfront payment", default OFF=required):
  - classes (Experiences) ffp-provider-classes-loader.js: select+form toggle (cm-allow-unpaid)+payload. ?v=20→21.
  - experiences (Trips) ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js: mapForUi+default+select+form toggle (xm-allow-unpaid)+
    payload. script ?v=15→16.
  - events ffp-provider-events-loader.js: mapForUi+select+payload wired (em-allow-unpaid); FORM toggle deferred
    (multi-step tier-pricing wizard) — events stay 'required' (appropriate for ticketed events). script ?v=17→18.
All 3 loaders node --check OK. provider_save_listing owner guard (83b) preserved.
Spec updated for Booking team (FFP Booking Platform/FFP-MEMBER-BOOKING-PAYMENT-SPEC.md): marketplace defaults to
'required' → don't confirm until paid.
DEPLOY: ffp-provider-classes-loader.js + ffp-provider-events-loader.js + ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js +
ffp-provider-dashboard.html → Netlify. DB live.
TODO (small): events form opt-out toggle in the Pricing step.

## (85) #1 END-TO-END BOOKING+PAYMENT VERIFICATION (2026-06-21) — all green, no deploy
Ran a full lifecycle in a ROLLED-BACK tx, ALL via a simulated NATIVE booking-platform session (claims sub=user_id)
to also prove the cross-surface identity bridge end to end. Results:
  1 facility session on TERM membership → paid_with=membership; cancel ok refund_pct=100.
  2 facility session on PACK → credit credits_left=4; cancel returns credit (back to 5) credit_returned=true.
  3 facility session no plan → needs_payment.
  4 pro slot on covering PACKAGE → credit; cancel returns credit (5) credit_returned=true.
  5 marketplace class → create_booking ok; resolver action=blocked_no_stripe (paid class, partner not on Stripe →
    not bookable online — exactly the pay-before-confirm rule); cancel ok.
  6 member_my_bookings(members.id) == member_my_bookings(user_id) → same set.
System hangs together across credit/membership/package/drop-in + cancel/credit-return + resolver + cross-surface.

## (86) #2 PUBLISH-TIME STRIPE GATE for paid marketplace listings (2026-06-21)
Rule: to LIST a paid Experience/Trip/Event the partner must connect Stripe (payment-before-confirmation needs it),
unless they explicitly allow booking without upfront payment (Experiences/Trips only; Events stay required).
- ffp-provider-auth.js: FFP_PROVIDER now carries payments_status + stripe_account_id (added to the providers
  select + the FFP_PROVIDER object). Script ?v=7→8.
- saveClass (classes/Experiences): if price>0 && !allow-unpaid && payments_status!=='connected' → block save with a
  prompt to connect Stripe or tick the allow box. ?v=21→22.
- experiences (Trips) save: same gate (xm-allow-unpaid). script ?v=16→17.
- events save: paid = price>0 OR any ticket-tier price>0; if paid && !connected → block (no allow opt-out — events
  stay payment-required). script ?v=18→19.
saveClass passes isolated node --check (full-file = RULE 3 truncation). DEPLOY: ffp-provider-auth.js +
ffp-provider-classes-loader.js + ffp-provider-events-loader.js + ffp-provider-experiences-loader.js +
ffp-provider-dashboard.html → Netlify. DB unchanged.

## (87) NOTIFICATIONS + EMAIL — FULL COVERAGE AUDIT & FIX (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Audited every booking + meetup stage × party × channel. Member email = a WHITELIST of titles on the
notifications AFTER-INSERT trigger (ffp_notification_member_email → /api/notifications/email-member); hosts
link to a members.id (professionals.member_id / providers.owner_user_id) so routing host notifications through
the notifications table emails them too.
GAPS FOUND + FIXED (migration `booking_notifications_full_coverage`):
  - Marketplace bookings (class/event/experience) notified NOBODY on the host side. Facility-session bookings
    emailed the host but no in-app. Member-cancel notified NO host (in-app or email).
  - Retired the session-only host-email trigger (ffp_booking_host_email); unified on the notifications pipeline.
  - NEW trg_booking_notify (AFTER INSERT): host 'New booking' notification (provider owner, all provider-side
    types; pro slots still notified inside pro_book_slot — no double) + member 'Booking confirmed' (status=confirmed).
  - Rewrote ffp_notify_booking_change: actor now = current_member_id() (cross-surface fix; raw auth.uid() was wrong
    on the booking platform) + when the MEMBER cancels → notify the HOST.
  - Whitelist += 'New booking','Booking rescheduled' → hosts emailed on new bookings; member-cancel emails host via
    existing 'Booking cancelled'.
  VERIFIED (rolled-back): new booking → host in-app YES + member confirm YES; member cancels → host notified YES.
MEETUPS (migration `meetup_notifications_email_coverage`): in-app already covered all flows; emails were missing
(titles not whitelisted; join title was dynamic). join_meetup title → fixed 'New join request' (name in body);
whitelist += 'New join request',"You're confirmed!",'Join request withdrawn','Someone left your meet-up',
'Meet-up cancelled'. VERIFIED (rolled-back): request→host, confirm→attendee, attendee-leave→host, host-cancel→
attendee all notify + are now emailable.
NO DEPLOY (all DB; emails use the already-deployed /api/notifications/email-member). NOTE: appointments product
(provider_book_appointment / confirm / no_show / reschedule) not audited here — verify separately if it doesn't
write to the bookings table (booking triggers only cover the bookings table).

## (88) APPOINTMENTS — notification/email coverage (was ZERO) (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Audit: appointments live in provider_appointments (NOT bookings; member_id=client; host-initiated via
provider_book_appointment, assert_provider_owner). ALL appointment fns (book/confirm/cancel/no_show/reschedule)
wrote NO notifications + NO email → appointments had ZERO notify coverage.
Migration `appointment_notifications_coverage`: ffp_appointment_notify() trigger on provider_appointments —
AFTER INSERT (status scheduled) → member 'New appointment'; AFTER UPDATE status→cancelled → 'Appointment
cancelled'; start_at changed (not cancelled) → 'Appointment rescheduled'. (confirm/no_show = host admin states,
no member notif.) Whitelist += 'New appointment','Appointment cancelled','Appointment rescheduled' → emailed too.
VERIFIED (rolled-back): book/reschedule/cancel → member notified YES (×3). NO DEPLOY.
NOTIFICATION/EMAIL COVERAGE NOW COMPLETE across: bookings (all 5 types, member+host), meetups (request/confirm/
leave/cancel, host+attendee), appointments (book/cancel/reschedule → member). All in-app + email via the
unified notifications→/api/notifications/email-member pipeline.

## (89) ADMIN NOTIFICATIONS + EMAIL (2026-06-21) — DB ONLY, LIVE
Admin = members role admin/super_admin; admin_users.id = members.id (1 admin: admin@findfitpeople.com).
Migration `admin_notifications_coverage`: helper ffp_notify_admins(title,body,link) inserts an audience='admin'
notification for every admin_users row (→ in-app + email via whitelist). Triggers AFTER INSERT:
provider_applications → 'New partner application'; feature_requests → 'New featured request'; payouts (status
pending) → 'New payout request'. Trigger on events/experiences/classes (INSERT/UPDATE → status 'pending', on
transition) → 'Listing to review'. Whitelist += those 4 titles → admin emailed via /api/notifications/email-member.
VERIFIED (rolled-back): notify_admins helper, payout-request, event→pending all reach the admin.
CAVEAT: admin EMAIL is reliable (whitelisted). Admin IN-APP shows only if the admin dashboard reads the
notifications table for the admin's member_id / audience='admin' (member dashboard does; admin dashboard not
verified here). Not covered (optional follow-ups): content_submissions review, member 'applications'.
NOTIFICATIONS/EMAIL now span members, professionals, partners, AND admin across bookings/meetups/appointments/
approvals/payouts/feature-requests.

## (90) LOG ACTIVITY — MULTI-PHOTO (up to 8) + GREEN SAVE-STRAP (2026-06-22)
DB migration `activity_logs_multi_photo` (LIVE): activity_logs.photos text[] added (cover stays in photo_url).
log_activity/update_activity: dropped 16-arg, recreated as 17-arg with p_photos text[] (null-filtered, trimmed,
capped 8; cover = photos[1] → photo_url). update with p_photos NULL keeps existing photos (no wipe). Read RPCs
member_activity_view + member_partner_activities now return photos. VERIFIED rolled-back: insert 3 → cover=#1;
view returns array; update→2 photos moves cover to new #1; null-photos update preserves the set.
Backend index.js v101 (NEEDS DEPLOY): GET /api/members/:id/activity-logs select += photos.
Frontend (NEEDS COMMIT):
  - ffp-member-dashboard.html v360, FFP_BUILD 402→403:
    * Log modal: single photo box → horizontal-scroll strip (#log-photos-strip), up to 8, first=COVER, ×-remove.
      window._logPhotos[]; ffpRenderLogPhotos / ffpLogPickPhoto / ffpLogRemovePhoto / ffpLogSetPhotos. saveLog
      sends p_photos + p_photo_url=cover. _ffpSaveThenShare carries photos.
    * Activity card hero → x-axis scroll-snap gallery when >1 photo; fixed caption/scrim (pointer-events:none);
      1/N counter updates on scroll. Single/zero photo = unchanged.
    * showToast(msg,type): type-based. SUCCESS = wide GREEN strap, full-width, centered text (every saved/
      confirmation message). CSS .toast-success/.toast-error/.toast-info/.toast-warning added.
    * Edit prefill Country+City via _ensureSelectOption → persist exactly as saved unless changed.
  - assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js (cache-bust via FFP_BUILD 403): maps r.photos on load+reload; list
    thumbnail shows a photo_library + count badge when >1.
UPDATE = NO NOTIFICATION: confirmed — edit path never calls /api/activity/notify and activity_logs has no
notify triggers. JS validated (node --check: loader, backend, isolated dashboard funcs all pass).
DEPLOY: commit the two frontend files (Netlify) AND index.js (Vercel) — photos only appear in the LIST after the
backend deploy; the activity card + log modal work as soon as the frontend is live.

## (91) PARTNER APPOINTMENTS CALENDAR — EMPTY (DUPLICATE FN) + EMAIL DETAILS (2026-06-22)
SYMPTOM: partner booked client into coach slots (Mon 8am/11am, Grant Goes w/ Hamd Khan @ Forge Fitness);
confirmation email arrived but the booking never showed on Appointments → Calendar tab.
ROOT CAUSE (client, not data): ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js declared `_apRangeBounds` TWICE — the
calendar version (line 122, returns Date {from,to}) and a REPORTS version (line 1118, takes a key, returns
ISO strings; with no key → {from:null,to:null}). JS hoisting → the later decl wins for ALL calls, so
apRenderCalendar()'s `_apRangeBounds()` hit the reports version → null bounds → `rb.from.toISOString()` threw
→ swallowed by try/catch → _apAppts=[]. Calendar showed ZERO appointments for everyone, always (data + RPC +
owner-guard were all fine — verified the 2 rows exist, join cleanly to active staff+member, provider owner =
7b0307bf passes assert_provider_owner). FIX (RULE 0.5, no patch): renamed the reports fn → `_apReportRange`
(+ its sole caller in apRenderReports). Calendar's `_apRangeBounds` (122) is now the only one. node --check OK.
Cache-bust: appointments loader ?v=10→11 in _provLoaderSrc (provider dashboard). After apSaveBooking the code
already calls apRenderCalendar() → now shows immediately. NEEDS COMMIT: ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js +
ffp-provider-dashboard.html (Netlify).
EMAIL DETAILS: migration `appointment_notify_full_details` (LIVE) — ffp_appointment_notify() body now includes
COACH (provider_staff.full_name) + LOCATION (providers.business_name + area/city) alongside service + date/time
(facility tz). Applies to New/Rescheduled/Cancelled appointment member notifications (→ email via whitelist).
VERIFIED body: "Your Personal Training with Hamd Khan at Forge Fitness + Performance, Meydan is booked for
Mon 22 Jun, 08:00." DB-only, no deploy. (Affects future bookings; the 2 already-sent emails were the old thin
form.)

## (92) MULTI-PHOTO FIXES — STRAP HIDDEN + CARD NOT SHOWING EXTRA PHOTOS (2026-06-22)
Grant test feedback: (a) extra photos "not saving", (b) green save-strap not showing — goes straight to Share.
DIAGNOSIS (verified): photos ARE saving — latest activity_logs row had photos[2] populated, cover=photo_url.
So (a) is a DISPLAY issue: the recent-activity LIST reads the backend endpoint /api/members/:id/activity-logs;
the photos[] column only returns once index.js v101 is deployed (Vercel), and the card opened from the list used
that cached (photo-less) row → showed 1 photo. (b) the share sheet overlay is z-index 100060 but the toast was
100000 → the strap rendered BEHIND the share screen.
FIXES (frontend only, NEEDS COMMIT):
  - ffp-member-dashboard.html v361, FFP_BUILD 403→404: toast z-index 100000 → 2147483000 (strap now shows over
    the share sheet, across the top — matches "before/while going to share").
  - assets/ffp-fitness-stats-loader.js: ffpOpenActivityCard now async — when the cached row has ≤1 photo it
    fetches member_activity_view (DB source of truth) and merges photos[] before rendering, so the x-axis gallery
    shows ALL photos WITHOUT depending on the backend list deploy. Isolated node --check OK (full-file bash check
    is unreliable here — the workspace mount serves a TRUNCATED copy; Edit/Read file API is intact).
NOTE: the LIST thumbnail count badge still needs index.js v101 deployed (list comes from backend). The card
gallery + save strap work as soon as the two frontend files are live.

## (93) PRO DASHBOARD — NOTIFICATIONS DRAWER + WORKFLOW-ONLY FILTER (2026-06-22)
ffp-professional-dashboard.html, PRO_BUILD 54→55 (NEEDS COMMIT, Netlify).
LAYOUT: the small top-right .nt-menu dropdown is now a right-side DRAWER matching the member Passport —
position:fixed, width:50vw (min 320 / max 480), height:100dvh, translateX slide-in, over a 60% scrim
(.nt-scrim). Added a close (×) button in the header; scrim + outside-click close it.
TYPE STYLE: each item now renders TITLE bold (800) on its own line and BODY in regular weight (400, muted)
beneath — was one bold "title — body" line.
WORKFLOW-ONLY: a pro shares one account with their member self, so the bell feed carried member-social noise.
New _proNotifIsWorkflow(n) filters loadProNotifs + the badge to professional-workflow items only — DROPS
member-personal/social by title ('logged an activity','added your passport','high five','wants to connect',
'wants to join','recommends a connection','meet-up','congratulated','you’re confirmed','your ffp booking',
'new connection','near you') and by member deep-link (activity=, #connections, panel-passport/meetups/fitness,
meetup=, rec=). KEEPS New booking / Booking cancelled / rescheduled / appointments / data-sharing / profile
approved / packages / payments etc.
BADGE: now counts only unread WORKFLOW items, using a local seen timestamp (localStorage ffp_pro_notifs_seen,
set on open) instead of the server's all-notifications unread count — so badge ↔ panel stay consistent and the
pro badge is decoupled from the member feed. Client-only; no backend/DB change. node --check (isolated) OK.

## (94) PRO NOTIFICATIONS — LIGHT CONFIRM + #0a3e44 ICONS + CLEAR ALL (2026-06-22)
ffp-professional-dashboard.html, PRO_BUILD 55→56 (NEEDS COMMIT, Netlify).
Grant feedback on (93): wants the LIGHT theme, branded #0a3e44 icon, and Clear all at top.
- LIGHT: the drawer already uses the pro light vars (--ffp-bg-2 #fff, --ffp-text #0f2327); the earlier dark
  show_widget PREVIEW was misleading, not the code. Re-previewed light to confirm.
- ICON: notification item icon colour set explicitly to #0a3e44 (was var(--ffp-purple), which already = #0a3e44
  in :root — now hardcoded for clarity per request).
- CLEAR ALL: added to the drawer header (left of the × close). clearProNotifs() mirrors the member Passport —
  persisted localStorage marker ffp_pro_notifs_cleared_at hides everything created at/before now (new ones still
  arrive), sets seen, empties list + badge, POSTs /notifications/seen. New _proNotifVisible() applies BOTH the
  workflow filter AND the cleared-at marker in loadProNotifs + proNotifBadge. node --check (isolated) OK.

## (95) PARTNER PORTAL — COSMETIC: SIDEBAR LOGO + CALENDAR COLOURS/24h + BOOK-GATE + DETAIL (2026-06-22)
Files (NEEDS COMMIT, Netlify): ffp-provider-dashboard.html, ffp-provider-appointments-loader.js (?v 11→12),
ffp-provider-profile-loader.js (?v 17→18).
1) SIDEBAR FOOT LOGO: bottom-left mark now shows the partner's logo (providers.logo_url) when set, else the
   initial. Set on BOOT (profile loader init after fetchProfile) + on SAVE (realSaveProfile) + dashboard
   saveProfile fallback. .sb-foot-mark gets overflow:hidden.
2) APPOINTMENTS CALENDAR (day + week): full 24h always viewable (startH=0/endH=24, scrolls). Legend colours —
   AVAILABLE = yellow (#FFE8A3 band / solid open-slot chips), BOOKED = solid green #1f9d57 white text
   (_apBlockColor: all active states green; no_show red, cancelled grey), BLOCKED = dark grey #3b4750 bands
   (new _apBlocksForDayCoach renders block windows in both day + week). Day-view footer = colour legend.
3) BOOK ONLY IN AVAILABILITY: new _apWithinAvailability(coach,date,sMin,eMin) — apSaveBooking rejects times
   outside a set availability window or inside a block; apDayColClick rejects clicks outside availability
   (toast: "No availability set there — set the coach's availability first"). (Client-side gate on both entry
   points; the booking RPC itself is unchanged.)
4) BOOKING DETAIL: apApptDetail rebuilt with a solid light card (bg #eef1f3), big bold dark client name + clear
   service/coach/time lines; _apStatusChip/_apPayChip now SOLID backgrounds with white/dark legible text
   (was translucent light-on-tint, hard to read on the light theme).
Validated: profile loader node --check OK; appointments edits (258–775) node --check OK in isolation (full-file
bash check unreliable — workspace mount serves a TRUNCATED copy; Edit/Read file API intact).

## (96) WORLD-CLASS: BOOK-INTO-AVAILABILITY ENFORCED AT THE SOURCE (DB) (2026-06-22) — LIVE
Migration `book_appointment_require_availability`: provider_book_appointment already guarded coach_busy +
coach_unavailable (provider_trainer_blocks) but did NOT require the slot to be inside a SET availability
window. Added an availability guard: the [start,start+dur] must fall fully inside an active
provider_trainer_slots window for that staff on that weekday (day_of_week) or specific slot_date, in the
FACILITY timezone; else returns {ok:false,error:'no_availability'}. Now NO surface (this UI, a future one,
a direct RPC call, or a race) can create an appointment outside availability — the client-side gate (loader
v12) is just fast UX feedback; the DB is authoritative. VERIFIED (live slots, Hamd Khan Tue/Wed 09–17):
Tue 10:00→allowed, Mon 08:00→blocked, Tue 16:30 60m (overruns 17:00)→blocked, Wed 09:00→allowed. (The two
Mon 8/11am appts from entry (91) were booked pre-guard — Monday has no availability for that coach.)

## (97) BOOKER → DIRECTORY AUTO-ADD + CLIENT PROFILE (profile/notes/history) (2026-06-22)
WORLD-CLASS foundation: one canonical client directory. Migration `autoadd_provider_member_and_client_profile`:
- ffp_autoadd_provider_member() trigger on bookings + provider_appointments AFTER INSERT → upserts a
  provider_members row (by provider+email) from members (name/email/phone/city/country/photo) if absent.
  So ANY booking from the booking platform now auto-adds the member to the partner's directory. Backfilled all
  existing bookers/appointment members (Grant → Forge Fitness verified). Idempotent (email-dedup, exception-safe).
- provider_member_profile(p_provider, p_member) — accepts EITHER a provider_members.id OR a platform members.id
  (resolves both via email; plans/notes keyed on provider_members.id, appointments/packages on members.id — the
  resilient `member_id in (pmid,mid)` matches either). Returns profile (contact/photo/tags/notes) + memberships
  (provider_member_plans) + packages (provider_client_packages) + full appointment history + stats
  (total_sessions/attended/no_shows/upcoming/total_spend). VERIFIED under owner session (rolled-back): name,
  pmid, stats(8 sessions), 8 appts.
- provider_set_member_notes(p_provider,p_pmid,p_notes) — save private notes from the profile.
UI (NEEDS COMMIT, Netlify): shared window.openClientProfile(memberId) + _renderClientProfile + saveClientNotes
defined ONCE in ffp-provider-dashboard.html (uses openModalShell/escHtml — both global), so the Members loader
AND the Appointments loader both reach it. Entry points: Members list row (name block + new person button →
openClientProfile(provider_members.id)); appointment detail client NAME is now a tappable link →
openClientProfile(a.member_id). Cache-bust: members ?v 7→8, appointments ?v 12→13. JS validated in isolation
(CP block, memberRow, apApptDetail all node --check OK; full-file bash checks unreliable — truncated mount).
ALSO this turn (96): provider_book_appointment now enforces book-into-availability at the DB (source of truth).

## (98) CLIENT PROFILE — TABBED, COMPACT REDESIGN (2026-06-22)
Grant: long single-scroll + big font = weak; growing sections need their own tabs, current at top, ~12px.
Rewrote _renderClientProfile in ffp-provider-dashboard.html (NEEDS COMMIT): pinned compact header (avatar 44px,
name 15px, contact 11.5px) + 5 mini stat cells (value 14px) + SEGMENTED TABS — Sessions / Plans & packages /
Notes (new cpTab() switches panes). CURRENT-AT-TOP: Sessions pane = Upcoming (asc) above Past (desc); Plans pane
merges memberships + packages, Active group above Past, each item tagged ·Membership/·Package with status pill.
Body 12px, subheads 9.5px. Modal head title = "Client profile" (name now lives in the body header, no dup).
node --check OK. DB unchanged. (Loaders members ?v8 / appointments ?v13 from (97) still pending commit.)
## (98b) Client profile — removed boxes (2026-06-22): stat boxes → borderless editorial ribbon (divider lines); segmented pill tabs → underline tabs (platform standard). node --check OK.

## (99) CLIENT RECORD — PROFILE + PAYMENTS TABS + SEARCH (2026-06-22)
Migration `client_profile_fields_and_payments` (LIVE): provider_members += emergency_contact_name/phone,
date_of_birth, goals, health_notes. provider_member_profile extended → profile.* (those fields) + payments[]
ledger (paid sessions + package purchases + paid bookings, desc by date) + stats.total_spend now includes
paid bookings. New provider_save_member_profile(p_provider,p_pmid,p jsonb) saves the editable fields. VERIFIED
under owner session (rolled-back): profile carries emergency field, payments[] present, total_spend computed.
UI (ffp-provider-dashboard.html, NEEDS COMMIT): client record now tabbed Profile · Sessions · Plans & packages ·
Payments · Notes (underline tabs, scroll-x). PROFILE = editable partner record (given/surname, email, phone,
DOB, status, city/country, emergency contact+phone, tags, goals, health notes/injuries) → saveClientProfile().
PAYMENTS = ledger + running total. SEARCH: a search box appears on list tabs (Sessions/Plans/Payments) and
filters rows via data-cps (cpSearch). cpTab tracks _cpActive + toggles the search box. Members DIRECTORY search
already existed (#mem-search → renderMembersList). node --check OK.
NEXT (74): FORMS — partner-customizable templates from day one; member e-signs in app (digital default) +
partner upload fallback; compliance status on the profile header; Forms tab. Dedicated build.

## (100) CLIENT RECORD → FULL-SCREEN DESKTOP + THREADED NOTES + LINKED ROWS + COMPACT MEMBERS (2026-06-22)
Grant: modal must be FULL screen (world-class flow); member strap too big for 100+ (needs sort); notes must be
separate entries; each row must link/drill-in. NOTE: partner dashboards are desktop/laptop-first.
DB: provider_member_notes table (thread) + provider_add_member_note / provider_delete_member_note +
backfill legacy single notes; provider_member_profile returns member_notes[]. (LIVE, verified.)
ffp-provider-dashboard.html (NEEDS COMMIT): openClientProfile now a FULL-SCREEN overlay (#cp-overlay, esc/back/
close) with a desktop two-column layout — LEFT rail (avatar 62px, name, contact, status, stat lines, vertical
nav) + RIGHT content. Rows in Sessions/Plans/Payments are EXPANDABLE (cpToggleRow → reveals detail: service/
coach/duration/payment/price etc.) = the drill-in "link" to each item. Notes tab = THREAD: add box +
timestamped entries (cpAddNote/cpDeleteNote/_cpRenderNotes), each note separate. Profile tab editable
(saveClientProfile). Search box on list tabs (cpSearch). node --check OK (isolated; mount truncates).
ffp-provider-members-loader.js ?v 8→9 (NEEDS COMMIT): memberRow now COMPACT (34px avatar, single dense row ~50px,
whole row opens profile) — scales to 100s. renderMembersList SORT via #mem-sort: Name A–Z / Recently added /
Status. Sort dropdown added beside #mem-search in the panel.
NEXT (74): FORMS subsystem.

## (101) FORMS SUBSYSTEM (templates + e-sign + upload + compliance) + ADD PACKAGE/PAYMENT (2026-06-22)
Grant: customizable templates from day one; member e-signs in app (digital default) + partner upload fallback.
DB (LIVE, verified end-to-end in rolled-back tx): tables provider_form_templates (partner-built: title/desc/
fields jsonb/requires_signature) + provider_member_forms (assignment snapshot + responses + signature_name/
signed_at + uploaded_file_url + status outstanding|completed + source member|upload). RPCs:
provider_save_form_template / list / delete; provider_assign_form (snapshots template, resolves member_id by
email, NOTIFIES member 'New form to complete' deep-linked ?form=<id>); provider_complete_form_upload (fallback);
provider_delete_member_form; member_forms_list / member_get_form / member_submit_form (sets responses+signature,
NOTIFIES provider owner 'Form completed'). provider_member_profile now returns forms[]. Email whitelist +=
'New form to complete','Form completed'. Storage bucket 'form-files' (public) + insert/read/update policies for
authenticated. VERIFIED: template→assign→member submit (sig 'Grant Goes')→provider profile.forms shows completed.
PROVIDER UI (ffp-provider-dashboard.html, NEEDS COMMIT): client record gets a FORMS tab (assign from templates,
status pills Outstanding/Signed/Uploaded, expand to view responses+signature, upload signed copy, remove) +
a compliance strip on the header (N forms outstanding / Forms complete) + a template BUILDER (_cpDialog stacked
above the full-screen record: title/desc/require-signature + dynamic fields text/textarea/yesno/date/consent,
Start-from Waiver/PAR-Q). node --check OK (exact block, isolated).
MEMBER UI: NEW ffp-member-forms-loader.js (?v=1) — window.FFPForms.open/list; auto-opens ?form= deep link;
full-screen fill+sign screen (yes/no, consent, text/date, type-to-sign), member_submit_form. Wired into
ffp-member-dashboard.html via <script> include. node --check OK.
ADD PACKAGE/PAYMENT (Grant follow-up): client record Plans tab "Add membership / package" + Payments tab
"Sell a package / membership" → cpAddPlan dialog lists provider_list_plans/packages → cpDoAssignPlan
(provider_assign_plan) / cpDoSellPackage (provider_sell_package, payment-method picker) → refresh. node --check OK.

## (102) CORRECTION — FORMS BELONG ON BOOKING, NOT PASSPORT (2026-06-22)
MISTAKE: member-facing forms were wired into the PASSPORT (premium app). Forms/waivers are a BOOKING-PLATFORM
feature. FIX: removed the <script src="ffp-member-forms-loader.js"> include from ffp-member-dashboard.html (forms
no longer load in the Passport). The orphan loader file remains in the Passport repo, UNHOOKED (left in place;
delete was declined) — reference only, not included anywhere.
DB (LIVE): member form RPCs made AUTH-BASED so the Booking site needs no member-id handling —
member_forms_list() / member_get_form(p_form_id) / member_submit_form(p_form_id,p_responses,p_signature_name)
now resolve the member via current_member_id() (dropped the old p_me signatures). provider_assign_form
notification deep-link repointed Passport → BOOKING: https://findfitpeople.com/forms.html?form=<id>.
DO NOT TOUCH the Booking platform code (per Grant). Handoff written: FFP-FORMS-BOOKING-HANDOFF.md (in the
Passport workspace) — full spec for Booking to build forms.html + js/forms.js (auth, the 3 RPCs, field types,
submit contract, two views). Partner-side Forms (templates/assign/upload/compliance in the dashboard) stays as
built — unaffected.

## (103) MEMBER CONNECTIONS — PASSPORT SEARCH + REMOVE "FROM YOUR PEOPLE" (2026-06-22)
DB (LIVE): member_search_passport(p_me, p_q) — name search across members (excl. self), returns
{id,name,photo,city,connection: connected|requested|incoming|none}, connected-first, limit 25. VERIFIED.
ffp-connections-feed-loader.js (?v 328→329, NEEDS COMMIT): added a search box at the top of the Connections
panel (#conn-panel-root) → FFPConnFeed.search() (debounced) → member_search_passport → results rows (avatar,
name, city + status-aware connect button: Add / Accept / Requested / ✓ Connected). FFPConnFeed.connect()
mirrors MeetMove.requestConnect (insert member_connections pending, or accept incoming → accepted); row tap →
openCard (passport). REMOVED the mixed "From your people" feed section (per Grant) — a connection's activity is
seen by tapping them. node --check OK.

## (104) CONNECTIONS REFINEMENTS — MEMBERS-ONLY SEARCH + SEARCH MODAL + [NAME]'S ACTIVITIES (2026-06-22)
DB (LIVE, verified): member_search_passport now EXCLUDES admins (admin_users) + partners (providers.owner_user_id)
— only passport members (10→8 results, FFP Admin gone). New member_connection_activities(p_me,p_other,p_limit)
→ a connection's recent SHARED activities (gated: must be accepted-connected); returns id/activity/photo_url/
photos/distance/duration/city/venue/logged_at (12 for Sunjay verified).
ffp-connections-feed-loader.js (?v 329→330, NEEDS COMMIT): (1) inline search → a STRAP "Find a connection" that
opens a MODAL (openDetailModal) with the search input + results (like People You Might Click With). (2) The
"From your people" feed is now "[Name]'s activities" — tapping a connection circle selects them (yellow ring)
and renders a horizontal SLIDER of their recent activities (thumbnail/photo or icon + activity + km/min + date);
tap a card → ffpViewSharedActivity; "Passport" link opens their card. Auto-selects the most-active connection so
the slider isn't empty. New code node --check OK (full-file bash check unreliable — stale/truncated mount; real
file verified complete via Read).

## (105) PARTNER DASHBOARD — FORMS POLISH + NAV RESTRUCTURE (2026-06-22)
ffp-provider-dashboard.html (NEEDS COMMIT). DB seed (LIVE).
- "Sell a package / membership" button (Payments tab of client record) → btn-pri (blue), matching the others.
- READY-TO-SEND STARTER FORMS: migration seed_default_form_templates(p_provider) inserts full Liability Waiver
  (emergency contact + medical + 3 acknowledgement/consent statements) and PAR-Q (the standard 7 screening
  questions + details + consent). Backfilled all 4 providers + AFTER INSERT trigger on providers auto-seeds new
  ones → both appear ready in Assign form. Verified 8 templates / 4 providers.
- NAV RESTRUCTURE:
  * Memberships & Packages → its OWN top-level panel (#panel-plans, nav 'plans', icon card_membership). Moved the
    plans-list out of Members. Removed the Members "Memberships & Packages" tab.
  * Communications → "Announcements" → its OWN panel (#panel-announcements, nav 'announcements', icon campaign).
    Moved comms-list out of Members; "New announcement" compose button. Removed the Members "Communications" tab.
    (Members panel now = Directory + Teams & Rosters.)
  * Sessions panel: "Timetable" is now the FIRST/active tab (was "Sessions").
  * Wiring: _provLoaderSrc maps plans+announcements → members loader; new _callWhenReady(fn) retries until the
    lazy loader defines the render fn; showPanel hooks render renderPlans / renderComms / renderTimetable on open.
  members loader unchanged (renderPlans→#plans-list, renderComms→#comms-list — ids moved with the content). JS
  additions node --check OK (isolated; full-file bash check unreliable — truncated mount).
- (Client profile Sessions rows already expand inline to show detail — "session click shows in profile area".)
